1086519,75,['2018-05-15t16:50:26.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/business/media/fox-disney-dana-walden-gary-newman.html,"It has been one of the most pressing questions in the TV industry: Will the Fox TV chiefs Dana Walden and Gary Newman head to Disney, or will they strike out on their own when their contracts expire in a couple of months?It may be a little longer before that question is ultimately answered.Ms. Walden and Mr. Newman, the co-chief executives of the Fox television group, are in advanced talks to extend their contracts with 21st Century Fox for an extra year, according to three people briefed on the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are ongoing.The new deal would give Ms. Walden and Mr. Newman time to figure out whether they will stick with the Fox broadcast network, go to Disney with much of 21st Century Fox‚s entertainment assets or look for other jobs. It would allow Ms. Walden and Mr. Newman to stay until a deal is closed, and would give them flexibility to leave sooner or stay later depending on when the sale is completed. Their current contracts with Fox are set to expire this summer.The Walt Disney Company reached an agreement for most of 21st Century Fox‚s entertainment properties in December. That deal is awaiting regulatory approval. Things could get complicated depending on the outcome of the Justice Department‚s lawsuit to stop AT&T‚s merger with Time Warner, or if Comcast, which made an offer for Fox before Disney did, goes ahead with  a hostile bid. However, barring those hiccups, the Disney deal could be completed within a year.Ms. Walden, who is known to have a deft hand with talent and is the godmother of the star showrunner Ryan Murphy‚s children, is one of the most powerful female executives in the television industry. She has run the broadcast network with Mr. Newman since 2014, and they have run Fox‚s TV studio together for almost two decades.But in the time since they‚ve run the broadcast network, Fox has not been able to climb out of a years-long slump that started when ratings for ‚American Idol‚ began to crater. The studio‚s biggest recent hit, ‚This Is Us,‚ airs on NBC.If 21st Century Fox is sold, the studio that Ms. Walden and Mr. Newman have curated for so long will be in unfamiliar hands. Fox, known for its edgier programming, and ABC have considerably different brands, and a transition to Disney could be tricky for Ms. Walden and Mr. Newman. Meanwhile, the Fox broadcast network will be in the awkward spot of having to navigate a future without an aligned studio providing new shows. The network will have to look elsewhere for content, meaning its programming will likely be heavy on sports, live events and reality television. The so-called New Fox would consist of the broadcast network, the Fox Sports channels, some local TV channels and Fox News. Some analysts have taken to calling this potential version of Fox ‚the stub.‚Earlier this year, Ms. Walden briefly spoke to Amazon for its chief entertainment job before pulling out. The position ultimately went to Jennifer Salke, a former colleague of Ms. Walden‚s.On Monday, Ms. Walden and Mr. Newman presided over Fox‚s annual upfront presentation for advertisers. The event was muted, by the usual glitz-and-glam standards of the upfronts, featuring lots of talk about future sports rights for Fox. Ms. Walden, who started her career in public relations, has been with Fox for decades. ‚It was a little stunning, having worked there for such a long time and having worked so closely with the Murdochs,‚ Ms. Walden said this year of the sale to Disney. ‚It just didn‚t seem to me like that was on the table.‚The fallout of the deal has already begun. Mr. Murphy, the executive producer behind ‚American Crime Story‚ and ‚Glee,‚ has already made a $300 million deal to go to Netflix. He showed up at Fox‚s upfront presentation on Monday, but his new deal with the streaming service begins in six weeks.","As Disney Sale Looms, Fox TV Chiefs Are Said to Discuss Extending Contracts","June 7, 2018 /  5:57 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-walt-disney/disney-fox-carved-out-assets-surgically-u-s-antitrust-chief-idUSKCN1J32GP,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) $52.4 billion deal to acquire most of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s (FOXA.O) assets was “surgically” structured on good advice to be submitted to regulators, Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division, said on Thursday.

(Disney) didn’t propose to acquire Fox Sports 1 and 2. They didn’t acquire Fox Broadcasting and say, you know what, we will combine this with ABC and don’t worry about it we’ll have an arbitrator decide if prices for advertisers go up or competition for content creators goes down,” Delrahim told The Deal’s annual corporate governance conference in New York. FILE PHOTO: The flag of the Twenty-First Century Fox Inc is seen waving at the company headquarters in the Manhattan borough in New York June 11, 2015.  REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo“They had good advice and carved out surgically ... a transaction that might be doable. But again, who knows where that transaction leads,” Delrahim added. Antitrust considerations have become especially important as Fox prepares to weigh a rival offer for the assets Disney agreed to buy last December. Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) said last month it was preparing an offer for the Fox assets that would top the deal with Disney. A regulatory filing in April showed that Comcast offered to acquire Fox’s assets for $64 billion last November, before it agreed to sell to Disney. Fox rejected Comcast’s offer, even though it was higher, partly because it was concerned it faced a greater risk of regulators shooting it down. Comcast is waiting to see if a U.S. federal judge will allow AT&T Inc’s (T.N) planned $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc TWX.N to proceed before submitting its new offer to Fox, sources have said. The Department of Justice has sued to block that deal, and Fox has cited the lawsuit as a reason why a tie-up with a cable operator such as Comcast could irk regulators. Reporting by Liana B.

And on Saturday, 82 women ‚ one for every female-directed film ever selected to compete for the main prize, or less than 5 percent of the total ‚ took over the red carpet for a rally.‚Women are not a minority in the world, yet the current state of our industry says otherwise,‚ Ms. Blanchett told the crowd in a message that was read out in French by the filmmaker Agn√®s Varda. Standing on the festival‚s carpeted staircase, lined with photographers and camera crews, Ms. Blanchett added, ‚Ladies, let‚s climb!‚ The reverberations of #MeToo are shaking up Cannes, now in the midst of its annual 11-day jamboree, where glitter and megayachts abound. But if the world‚s most prestigious cinema competition is reckoning with the industry‚s dark past, Cannes also must deal with its own present-day deficits. Of the 21 films vying for the Palme d‚Or this year, for example, programmers picked only three directed by women. The festival, now in its 71st edition, is not just a launchpad for highbrow films. It‚s also a freewheeling marketplace for movie deals, and a place of parties and excess that for years served as a commercial and recreational playground for the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein is currently fighting allegations of sexual misconduct made by dozens of women, at least two of them relating to episodes that took place during past editions of the festival. (Mr. Weinstein has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex.)While he was absent this year, the sexualized atmosphere of his heyday remains. Outside the festival‚s seafront headquarters, young women in hot pants roller skate around distributing copies of a fashion magazine. Aspiring actresses appear on and off the red carpet in see-through or low-cut dresses in the hopes of attracting the attention of male producers, directors, talent scouts and photographers.It is well known among festival attendees that escorts ply their trade in the lobbies of Cannes‚ upmarket hotels. Within 10 minutes of entering one, a reporter was approached by two women, one of whom told him she would go back to his apartment in exchange for 600 euros, or about $700. ‚Cinema is a world that is founded on desire: the desire of producers and directors to make movies with this or that actress, the desire of spectators to watch those movies ‚ and that desire is based, also, on physical attraction,‚ Marl√®ne Schiappa, France‚s junior minister for gender equality, said in an interview. When combined with ‚power, visibility, notoriety and money,‚ she said, the result is ‚a cocktail of factors‚ that could lead to excesses.The reports about Mr. Weinstein were embarrassing to Cannes when they surfaced in October. The organization‚s president, Pierre Lescure, and artistic director, Thierry Fr√©maux, said in a statement at the time that they were ‚dismayed‚ by the charges against someone who was ‚a familiar figure‚ at the festival.‚These actions point to a pattern of behavior that merits only the clearest and most unequivocal condemnation,‚ they said, adding that they hoped the case would ‚help us once again to denounce all such serious and unacceptable practices.‚ But French reaction to the ensuing #MeToo movement has not been as unambivalent. In January, the renowned French actress Catherine Deneuve and more than 100 other women published a letter in the newspaper Le Monde saying that the movement had gone too far. While rape was a crime, they said, ‚insistent or clumsy flirting is not a crime, nor is gallantry a chauvinist aggression.‚And while Mr. Fr√©maux, the artistic director, has acknowledged criticisms of gender imbalance at Cannes, he also has said that films are chosen on merit and that he opposes the idea of pro-women quotas and ‚positive discrimination.‚ The festival has long been a showcase for acclaimed male directors like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino and Pedro Almod√≥var, and it is nothing if not tradition-bound. At this year‚s event, selfies were banned on the red carpet for causing disruption, and Netflix productions were kept out of competition because the company refused to follow the practice of showing Cannes titles in French theaters (which, under French law, would prevent them from being streamed online in France for three years).Still, a new attitude toward gender equality, and the abuse of power, has been conspicuous throughout the festival.At the American pavilion, an independently operated tent where experienced and emerging filmmakers come together, visitors were required to sign an electronic form warning that their membership could be revoked if they committed harassment.The hotline is another widely publicized new feature. Operators would not say how many calls they had received, but according to Ms. Schiappa, the gender-equality minister, the service had already arranged for a woman to be accompanied to the police station to file a complaint. And the festival‚s choice of Ms. Blanchett as jury president was not accidental: She is one of the campaigners who helped establish the Time‚s Up organization against sexual harassment. On Monday, Mr. Fr√©maux and the heads of the festival‚s two sidebar sections (Directors‚ Fortnight and Critics‚ Week) signed a charter committing to gender equality and vowed to publish gender breakdowns of the number of films submitted to the festival each year and to reveal the composition of the selection committees. The organization behind the red-carpet rally on Saturday had been seeking such commitments since 2013.The French filmmaker Eva Husson, one of the three women vying for this year‚s Palme d‚Or, said it took her six years to make her first movie, ‚Bang Gang,‚ and that it had been tough to raise the 4 million euros needed to make her latest movie, ‚Girls of the Sun,‚ the story of female fighters in Iraqi Kurdistan taking on the Islamic State. A male filmmaker making a war movie would raise twice as much, she said in an interview.One explanation offered for the lack of female directors at Cannes is that they simply produce fewer movies, a fact that has brought calls for government support for female filmmakers in France. While 52 percent of its population is female, only 23 percent of its directors are women, according to the group that staged the rally. ‚A society that doesn‚t represent itself equitably is a sick society,‚ Ms. Husson said.Even so, she said that a lot of what she had seen at Cannes and beyond gave her some optimism. The day after the red-carpet rally ‚ which included the actress Salma Hayek, who has accused Mr. Weinstein of harassment ‚ the French culture minister, Fran√ßoise Nyssen, announced at the festival that she was ready to introduce rules making film subsidies conditional upon gender-parity and equal-pay targets.‚I‚m super-enthusiastic, because the other way of looking at things is that everything remains to be done,‚ Ms. Husson said. ‚A golden era could now begin. We must seize the moment.‚","Cannes, Where Weinstein Reigned, Reckons With #MeToo Fallout","May 19, 2018 /  8:19 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-filmfestival-cannes-asia-argento/weinstein-accuser-argento-warns-others-at-cannes-we-know-who-you-are-idUSKCN1IK0T9,"CANNES, France (Reuters) - Italian actress Asia Argento, who has accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, told the closing ceremony of the Cannes Film Festival there were abusers in the audience who had yet to be outed. 71st Cannes Film Festival – Closing ceremony – Cannes, France, May 19, 2018.

Slideshow (4 Images)“You know who you are, but, most importantly, we know who you are, and we are not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she ended her speech, to applause. Weinstein’s attorney in Italy, Filomena Cusano, was in Cannes as Argento spoke and said there was as much stunned silence in the hall as there was applause. “The allegations by Ms. Argento are completely false. Mr. Weinstein had a consensual relationship with Ms. Argento, and she starred in Mr. Weinstein’s film B. Monkey in 1998, in which Argento was excellent, and she herself said was a fantastic role for her,” Cusano said in a statement. “After that, she wrote a script for Mr. Weinstein about Italian director Vittorio De Sica that he wishes could have been produced. This is clearly a painful time for Ms. Argento, but it is a false narrative. Mr. Weinstein only wishes Ms. Argento well.” Organizers of the festival, which began on May 9, set up a telephone hotline for victims of harassment, and several discussion groups addressed the issues of sexual abuse and the under-representation of women in the film business.

67592,3,['2018-05-15t14:54:31.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/obituaries/tom-wolfe-pyrotechnic-nonfiction-writer-and-novelist-dies-at-88.html,"Tom Wolfe, an innovative journalist and novelist whose technicolor, wildly punctuated prose brought to life the worlds of California surfers, car customizers, astronauts and Manhattan‚s moneyed status-seekers in works like ‚The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,‚ ‚The Right Stuff‚ and ‚Bonfire of the Vanities,‚ died on Monday in a Manhattan hospital. He was 88.His death was confirmed by his agent, Lynn Nesbit, who said Mr. Wolfe had been hospitalized with an infection. He had lived in New York since joining The New York Herald Tribune as a reporter in 1962.In his use of novelistic techniques in his nonfiction, Mr. Wolfe, beginning in the 1960s, helped create the enormously influential hybrid known as the New Journalism.But as an unabashed contrarian, he was almost as well known for his attire as his satire. He was instantly recognizable as he strolled down Madison Avenue ‚ a tall, slender, blue-eyed, still boyish-looking man in his spotless three-piece vanilla bespoke suit, pinstriped silk shirt with a starched white high collar, bright handkerchief peeking from his breast pocket, watch on a fob, faux spats and white shoes. Once asked to describe his get-up, Mr. Wolfe replied brightly, ‚Neo-pretentious.‚ It was a typically wry response from a writer who found delight in lacerating the pretentiousness of others. He had a pitiless eye and a penchant for spotting trends and then giving them names, some of which ‚ like ‚Radical Chic‚ and ‚the Me Decade‚ ‚ became American idioms.His talent as a writer and caricaturist was evident from the start in his verbal pyrotechnics and perfect mimicry of speech patterns, his meticulous reporting, and his creative use of pop language and explosive punctuation.‚As a titlist of flamboyance he is without peer in the Western world,‚ Joseph Epstein wrote in the The New Republic. ‚His prose style is normally shotgun baroque, sometimes edging over into machine-gun rococo, as in his article on Las Vegas which begins by repeating the word ‚hernia‚ 57 times.‚William F. Buckley Jr., writing in National Review, put it more simply: ‚He is probably the most skillful writer in America ‚ I mean by that he can do more things with words than anyone else.‚ From 1965 to 1981 Mr. Wolfe produced nine nonfiction books. ‚The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,‚ an account of his reportorial travels in California with Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters as they spread the gospel of LSD, remains a classic chronicle of the counterculture, ‚still the best account ‚ fictional or non, in print or on film ‚ of the genesis of the ‚60s hipster subculture,‚ the media critic Jack Shafer wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review on the book‚s 40th anniversary. Even more impressive, to many critics, was ‚The Right Stuff,‚ his exhaustively reported narrative about the first American astronauts and the Mercury space program. The book, adapted into a film in 1983 with a cast that included Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid and Ed Harris, made the test pilot Chuck Yeager a cultural hero and added yet another phrase to the English language. It won the National Book Award.At the same time, Mr. Wolfe continued to turn out a stream of essays and magazine pieces for New York, Harper‚s and Esquire. His theory of literature, which he preached in print and in person and to anyone who would listen, was that journalism and nonfiction had ‚wiped out the novel as American literature‚s main event.‚After ‚The Right Stuff,‚ published in 1979, he confronted what he called ‚the question that rebuked every writer who had made a point of experimenting with nonfiction over the preceding 10 or 15 years: Are you merely ducking the big challenge ‚ The Novel?‚‚The Bonfire of the Vanities‚The answer came with ‚The Bonfire of the Vanities.‚ Published initially as a serial in Rolling Stone magazine and in book form in 1987 after extensive revisions, it offered a sweeping, bitingly satirical picture of money, power, greed and vanity in New York during the shameless excesses of the 1980s.The action jumps back and forth from Park Avenue to Wall Street to the terrifying holding pens in Bronx Criminal Court, after the Yale-educated bond trader Sherman McCoy (a self-proclaimed ‚Master of the Universe‚) becomes lost in the Bronx at night in his Mercedes with his foxy young mistress, Maria. After the car, with Maria at the wheel, runs over a black man and nearly ignites a race riot, Sherman enters the nightmare world of the criminal justice system.Although a runaway best seller, ‚Bonfire‚ divided critics into two camps: those who praised its author as a worthy heir of his fictional idols Balzac, Zola, Dickens and Dreiser, and those who dismissed the book as clever journalism, a charge that would dog him throughout his fictional career. Mr. Wolfe responded with a manifesto in Harper‚s, ‚Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast,‚ in which he lambasted American fiction for failing to perform the time-honored sociological duty of reporting on the facts of contemporary life, in all their complexity and variety.His second novel, ‚A Man in Full‚ (1998), also a whopping commercial success, was another sprawling social panorama. Set in Atlanta, it charted the rise and fall of Charlie Croker, a 60-year-old former Georgia Tech football star turned millionaire real estate developer.Mr. Wolfe‚s fictional ambitions and commercial success earned him enemies ‚ big ones.‚Extraordinarily good writing forces one to contemplate the uncomfortable possibility that Tom Wolfe might yet be seen as our best writer,‚ Norman Mailer wrote in The New York Review of Books. ‚How grateful one can feel then for his failures and his final inability to be great ‚ his absence of truly large compass. There may even be an endemic inability to look into the depth of his characters with more than a consummate journalist‚s eye.‚‚Tom may be the hardest-working show-off the literary world has ever owned,‚ Mr. Mailer continued. ‚But now he will no longer belong to us. (If indeed he ever did!) He lives in the King Kong Kingdom of the Mega-bestsellers ‚ he is already a Media Immortal. He has married his large talent to real money and very few can do that or allow themselves to do that.‚ Mr. Mailer‚s sentiments were echoed by John Updike and John Irving.Two years later, Mr. Wolfe took revenge. In an essay titled ‚My Three Stooges,‚ included in his 2001 collection, ‚Hooking Up,‚ he wrote that his eminent critics had clearly been ‚shaken‚ by ‚A Man in Full‚ because it was an ‚intensely realistic novel, based upon reporting, that plunges wholeheartedly into the social reality of America today, right now,‚ and it signaled the new direction in late-20th- and early-21st-century literature and would soon make many prestigious artists, ‚such as our three old novelists, appear effete and irrelevant.‚And, he added, ‚It must gall them a bit that everyone ‚ even them ‚ is talking about me, and nobody is talking about them.‚ Cocky words from a man best known for his gentle manner and unfailing courtesy in person. For many years Mr. Wolfe lived a relatively private life in his 12-room apartment on the Upper East Side with his wife, Sheila (Berger) Wolfe, a graphic designer and former art director of Harper‚s Magazine, whom he married when he was 48 years old. She and their two children, Alexandra Wolfe, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, and Tommy Wolfe, a sculptor and furniture designer, survive him.Every morning he dressed in one of his signature outfits ‚ a silk jacket, say, and double-breasted white vest, shirt, tie, pleated pants, red-and-white socks and white shoes ‚ and sat down at his typewriter. Every day he set himself a quota of 10 pages, triple-spaced. If he finished in three hours, he was done for the day.‚If it takes me 12 hours, that‚s too bad, I‚ve got to do it,‚ he told George Plimpton in a 1991 interview for The Paris Review.For many summers the Wolfes rented a house in Southampton, N.Y., where Mr. Wolfe continued to observe his daily writing routine as well as the fitness regimen from which he rarely faltered. In 1996 he suffered a heart attack at his gym and underwent quintuple bypass surgery. A period of severe depression followed, which Charlie Croker relived, in fictional form, in ‚A Man in Full.‚As for his remarkable attire, he called it ‚a harmless form of aggression.‚‚I found early in the game that for me there‚s no use trying to blend in,‚ he told The Paris Review. ‚I might as well be the village information-gatherer, the man from Mars who simply wants to know. Fortunately the world is full of people with information-compulsion who want to tell you their stories. They want to tell you things that you don‚t know.‚The eccentricities of his adult life were a far cry from the normalcy of his childhood, which by all accounts was a happy one.A Professor‚s SonThomas Kennerly Wolfe Jr. was born on March 2, 1930, in Richmond, Va. His father was a professor of agronomy at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, editor of The Southern Planter, an agricultural journal, and director of distribution for the Southern States Cooperative, which later became a Fortune 500 Company. His mother, Helen Perkins Hughes Wolfe, a garden designer, encouraged him to become an artist and gave him a love of reading. Young Tom was educated at a private boys‚ school in Richmond. He graduated cum laude from Washington and Lee University in 1951 with a bachelor‚s degree in English and enough skill as a pitcher to earn a tryout with the New York Giants. He did not make the cut. He enrolled at Yale University in the American studies program and received his Ph.D. in 1957. After sending out job applications to more than 100 newspapers and receiving three responses, two of them ‚no,‚ he went to work as a general-assignment reporter at The Springfield Union in Springfield, Mass., and later joined the staff of The Washington Post. He was assigned to cover Latin America and in 1961 won an award for a series on Cuba.In 1962, Mr. Wolfe joined The Herald Tribune as a reporter on the city desk, where he found his voice as a social chronicler. Fascinated by the status wars and shifting power bases of the city, he poured his energy and insatiable curiosity into his reporting and soon became one of the stars on the staff. The next year he began writing for New York, the newspaper‚s newly revamped Sunday supplement, edited by Clay Felker.‚Together they attacked what each regarded as the greatest untold and uncovered story of the age: the vanities, extravagances, pretensions and artifice of America two decades after World War II, the wealthiest society the world had ever known,‚ Richard Kluger wrote in ‚The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune‚ (1986).Those were heady days for journalists. Mr. Wolfe became one of the standard-bearers of the New Journalism, along with Jimmy Breslin, Gay Talese, Hunter Thompson, Joan Didion and others. Most were represented in ‚The New Journalism‚ (1973), an anthology he edited with E. W. Johnson.In an author‚s statement for the reference work World Authors, Mr. Wolfe wrote that to him the term ‚meant writing nonfiction, from newspaper stories to books, using basic reporting to gather the material but techniques ordinarily associated with fiction, such as scene-by-scene construction, to narrate it.‚ He added, ‚In nonfiction I could combine two loves: reporting and the sociological concepts American Studies had introduced me to, especially status theory as first developed by the German sociologist Max Weber.‚It was the perfect showcase for his own extravagant and inventive style, increasingly on display in Esquire, for which he began writing during the 1963 New York City newspaper strike.One of his most dazzling essays for Esquire, about the subculture of car customizers in Los Angeles, started out as a 49-page memo to Byron Dobell, his editor there, who simply deleted the words ‚Dear Byron‚ at the top of the page and ran it as is. It became the title essay in Mr. Wolfe‚s first collection, ‚The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby,‚ published in 1968.‚Girl of the Year,‚ his 1964 portrait of the Manhattan ‚it‚ girl Baby Jane Holzer, opened with the literary equivalent of a cinematic pan shot at a Rolling Stones concert:‚Bangs manes bouffants beehive Beatle caps butter faces brush-on lashes decal eyes puffy sweaters French thrust bras flailing leather blue jeans stretch pants stretch jeans honey dew bottoms √©clair shanks elf boots ballerinas Knight slippers, hundreds of them these flaming little buds, bobbing and screaming, rocketing around inside the Academy of Music Theater underneath that vast old moldering cherub dome up there ‚ aren‚t they super-marvelous?‚‚Radical Chic‚ SkeweredIn June 1970, New York magazine devoted an entire issue to ‚These Radical Chic Evenings,‚ Mr. Wolfe‚s 20,000-word sendup of a fund-raiser given for the Black Panthers by Leonard Bernstein, the conductor of the New York Philharmonic, and his wife, the Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, in their 13-room Park Avenue penthouse duplex ‚ an affair attended by scores of the Bernsteins‚ liberal, rich and mostly famous friends.‚Do Panthers like little Roquefort cheese morsels rolled on crushed nuts this way, and asparagus tips in mayonnaise dabs, and meatballs petites au Coq Hardi, all of which are at the very moment being offered to them on gadrooned silver platters by maids in black uniforms with hand-ironed white aprons?,‚ Mr. Wolfe wrote, outraging liberals and Panthers alike. When a Time reporter asked a minister for the Black Panthers to comment on the accuracy of Mr. Wolfe‚s account, he said, ‚You mean that dirty, blatant, lying, racist dog who wrote that fascist disgusting thing in New York magazine?‚The article was included in Mr. Wolfe‚s essay collection ‚Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers,‚ published in 1970.Storms did not seem to bother Mr. Wolfe, as his forays into the art world demonstrated. He had always had an interest in art and was indeed an artist himself, sometimes illustrating his work with pen-and-ink drawings. He was a contributing artist at Harper‚s from 1978 to 1981 and exhibited his work on occasion at Manhattan galleries. Many of his illustrations were collected in ‚In Our Time‚ (1980).Earlier, in ‚The Painted Word‚ (1975), he produced a gleeful screed denouncing contemporary art as a con job perpetrated by cultural high priests, notably the critics Clement Greenberg, Harold Rosenberg and Leo Steinberg ‚ ‚the kings of cultureburg,‚ as he called them.The art world, en masse, rejected the argument, and the book, with disdain.‚If someone who is tone-deaf goes to Carnegie Hall every night of the year, he is, of course, entitled to his opinion of what he has listened to, just as a eunuch is entitled to his opinion of sex,‚ the art critic John Russell wrote in The New York Times Book Review.Undeterred, in ‚From Bauhaus to Our House,‚ Mr. Wolfe attacked modern architecture and what he saw as its determination to put dogma before buildings. Published in 1981, it met with the same derisive response from critics. ‚The problem, I think,‚ Paul Goldberger wrote in The Times Book Review, ‚is that Tom Wolfe has no eye.‚Mr. Wolfe‚s later novels earned mixed reviews. Many critics found ‚I Am Charlotte Simmons‚ (2004), about a na√Øve freshman‚s disillusioning experiences at a liberal arts college fueled by sex and alcohol, unconvincing and out of touch. In ‚Back to Blood‚ (2012), Mr. Wolfe created one of his most sympathetic, multidimensional characters in Nestor Camacho, a young Cuban-American police officer trying to navigate the treacherous waters of multiethnic Miami.

He was 88.His death was confirmed by his agent, Lynn Nesbit, who said Mr. Wolfe had been hospitalized with an infection. He had lived in New York since joining The New York Herald Tribune as a reporter in 1962.In his use of novelistic techniques in his nonfiction, Mr. Wolfe, beginning in the 1960s, helped create the enormously influential hybrid known as the New Journalism.But as an unabashed contrarian, he was almost as well known for his attire as his satire. He was instantly recognizable as he strolled down Madison Avenue ‚ a tall, slender, blue-eyed, still boyish-looking man in his spotless three-piece vanilla bespoke suit, pinstriped silk shirt with a starched white high collar, bright handkerchief peeking from his breast pocket, watch on a fob, faux spats and white shoes. Once asked to describe his get-up, Mr. Wolfe replied brightly, ‚Neo-pretentious.‚ It was a typically wry response from a writer who found delight in lacerating the pretentiousness of others. He had a pitiless eye and a penchant for spotting trends and then giving them names, some of which ‚ like ‚Radical Chic‚ and ‚the Me Decade‚ ‚ became American idioms.His talent as a writer and caricaturist was evident from the start in his verbal pyrotechnics and perfect mimicry of speech patterns, his meticulous reporting, and his creative use of pop language and explosive punctuation.‚As a titlist of flamboyance he is without peer in the Western world,‚ Joseph Epstein wrote in the The New Republic. ‚His prose style is normally shotgun baroque, sometimes edging over into machine-gun rococo, as in his article on Las Vegas which begins by repeating the word ‚hernia‚ 57 times.‚William F. Buckley Jr., writing in National Review, put it more simply: ‚He is probably the most skillful writer in America ‚ I mean by that he can do more things with words than anyone else.‚ From 1965 to 1981 Mr. Wolfe produced nine nonfiction books. ‚The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,‚ an account of his reportorial travels in California with Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters as they spread the gospel of LSD, remains a classic chronicle of the counterculture, ‚still the best account ‚ fictional or non, in print or on film ‚ of the genesis of the ‚60s hipster subculture,‚ the media critic Jack Shafer wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review on the book‚s 40th anniversary. Even more impressive, to many critics, was ‚The Right Stuff,‚ his exhaustively reported narrative about the first American astronauts and the Mercury space program. The book, adapted into a film in 1983 with a cast that included Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid and Ed Harris, made the test pilot Chuck Yeager a cultural hero and added yet another phrase to the English language. It won the National Book Award.At the same time, Mr. Wolfe continued to turn out a stream of essays and magazine pieces for New York, Harper‚s and Esquire. His theory of literature, which he preached in print and in person and to anyone who would listen, was that journalism and nonfiction had ‚wiped out the novel as American literature‚s main event.‚After ‚The Right Stuff,‚ published in 1979, he confronted what he called ‚the question that rebuked every writer who had made a point of experimenting with nonfiction over the preceding 10 or 15 years: Are you merely ducking the big challenge ‚ The Novel?‚‚The Bonfire of the Vanities‚The answer came with ‚The Bonfire of the Vanities.‚ Published initially as a serial in Rolling Stone magazine and in book form in 1987 after extensive revisions, it offered a sweeping, bitingly satirical picture of money, power, greed and vanity in New York during the shameless excesses of the 1980s.The action jumps back and forth from Park Avenue to Wall Street to the terrifying holding pens in Bronx Criminal Court, after the Yale-educated bond trader Sherman McCoy (a self-proclaimed ‚Master of the Universe‚) becomes lost in the Bronx at night in his Mercedes with his foxy young mistress, Maria. After the car, with Maria at the wheel, runs over a black man and nearly ignites a race riot, Sherman enters the nightmare world of the criminal justice system.Although a runaway best seller, ‚Bonfire‚ divided critics into two camps: those who praised its author as a worthy heir of his fictional idols Balzac, Zola, Dickens and Dreiser, and those who dismissed the book as clever journalism, a charge that would dog him throughout his fictional career. Mr. Wolfe responded with a manifesto in Harper‚s, ‚Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast,‚ in which he lambasted American fiction for failing to perform the time-honored sociological duty of reporting on the facts of contemporary life, in all their complexity and variety.His second novel, ‚A Man in Full‚ (1998), also a whopping commercial success, was another sprawling social panorama. Set in Atlanta, it charted the rise and fall of Charlie Croker, a 60-year-old former Georgia Tech football star turned millionaire real estate developer.Mr. Wolfe‚s fictional ambitions and commercial success earned him enemies ‚ big ones.‚Extraordinarily good writing forces one to contemplate the uncomfortable possibility that Tom Wolfe might yet be seen as our best writer,‚ Norman Mailer wrote in The New York Review of Books. ‚How grateful one can feel then for his failures and his final inability to be great ‚ his absence of truly large compass. There may even be an endemic inability to look into the depth of his characters with more than a consummate journalist‚s eye.‚‚Tom may be the hardest-working show-off the literary world has ever owned,‚ Mr. Mailer continued. ‚But now he will no longer belong to us. (If indeed he ever did!) He lives in the King Kong Kingdom of the Mega-bestsellers ‚ he is already a Media Immortal. He has married his large talent to real money and very few can do that or allow themselves to do that.‚ Mr. Mailer‚s sentiments were echoed by John Updike and John Irving.Two years later, Mr. Wolfe took revenge. In an essay titled ‚My Three Stooges,‚ included in his 2001 collection, ‚Hooking Up,‚ he wrote that his eminent critics had clearly been ‚shaken‚ by ‚A Man in Full‚ because it was an ‚intensely realistic novel, based upon reporting, that plunges wholeheartedly into the social reality of America today, right now,‚ and it signaled the new direction in late-20th- and early-21st-century literature and would soon make many prestigious artists, ‚such as our three old novelists, appear effete and irrelevant.‚And, he added, ‚It must gall them a bit that everyone ‚ even them ‚ is talking about me, and nobody is talking about them.‚ Cocky words from a man best known for his gentle manner and unfailing courtesy in person. For many years Mr. Wolfe lived a relatively private life in his 12-room apartment on the Upper East Side with his wife, Sheila (Berger) Wolfe, a graphic designer and former art director of Harper‚s Magazine, whom he married when he was 48 years old. She and their two children, Alexandra Wolfe, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, and Tommy Wolfe, a sculptor and furniture designer, survive him.Every morning he dressed in one of his signature outfits ‚ a silk jacket, say, and double-breasted white vest, shirt, tie, pleated pants, red-and-white socks and white shoes ‚ and sat down at his typewriter. Every day he set himself a quota of 10 pages, triple-spaced. If he finished in three hours, he was done for the day.‚If it takes me 12 hours, that‚s too bad, I‚ve got to do it,‚ he told George Plimpton in a 1991 interview for The Paris Review.For many summers the Wolfes rented a house in Southampton, N.Y., where Mr. Wolfe continued to observe his daily writing routine as well as the fitness regimen from which he rarely faltered. In 1996 he suffered a heart attack at his gym and underwent quintuple bypass surgery. A period of severe depression followed, which Charlie Croker relived, in fictional form, in ‚A Man in Full.‚As for his remarkable attire, he called it ‚a harmless form of aggression.‚‚I found early in the game that for me there‚s no use trying to blend in,‚ he told The Paris Review. ‚I might as well be the village information-gatherer, the man from Mars who simply wants to know. Fortunately the world is full of people with information-compulsion who want to tell you their stories. They want to tell you things that you don‚t know.‚The eccentricities of his adult life were a far cry from the normalcy of his childhood, which by all accounts was a happy one.A Professor‚s SonThomas Kennerly Wolfe Jr. was born on March 2, 1930, in Richmond, Va. His father was a professor of agronomy at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, editor of The Southern Planter, an agricultural journal, and director of distribution for the Southern States Cooperative, which later became a Fortune 500 Company. His mother, Helen Perkins Hughes Wolfe, a garden designer, encouraged him to become an artist and gave him a love of reading. Young Tom was educated at a private boys‚ school in Richmond. He graduated cum laude from Washington and Lee University in 1951 with a bachelor‚s degree in English and enough skill as a pitcher to earn a tryout with the New York Giants. He did not make the cut. He enrolled at Yale University in the American studies program and received his Ph.D. in 1957. After sending out job applications to more than 100 newspapers and receiving three responses, two of them ‚no,‚ he went to work as a general-assignment reporter at The Springfield Union in Springfield, Mass., and later joined the staff of The Washington Post. He was assigned to cover Latin America and in 1961 won an award for a series on Cuba.In 1962, Mr. Wolfe joined The Herald Tribune as a reporter on the city desk, where he found his voice as a social chronicler. Fascinated by the status wars and shifting power bases of the city, he poured his energy and insatiable curiosity into his reporting and soon became one of the stars on the staff. The next year he began writing for New York, the newspaper‚s newly revamped Sunday supplement, edited by Clay Felker.‚Together they attacked what each regarded as the greatest untold and uncovered story of the age: the vanities, extravagances, pretensions and artifice of America two decades after World War II, the wealthiest society the world had ever known,‚ Richard Kluger wrote in ‚The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune‚ (1986).Those were heady days for journalists. Mr. Wolfe became one of the standard-bearers of the New Journalism, along with Jimmy Breslin, Gay Talese, Hunter Thompson, Joan Didion and others. Most were represented in ‚The New Journalism‚ (1973), an anthology he edited with E. W. Johnson.In an author‚s statement for the reference work World Authors, Mr. Wolfe wrote that to him the term ‚meant writing nonfiction, from newspaper stories to books, using basic reporting to gather the material but techniques ordinarily associated with fiction, such as scene-by-scene construction, to narrate it.‚ He added, ‚In nonfiction I could combine two loves: reporting and the sociological concepts American Studies had introduced me to, especially status theory as first developed by the German sociologist Max Weber.‚It was the perfect showcase for his own extravagant and inventive style, increasingly on display in Esquire, for which he began writing during the 1963 New York City newspaper strike.One of his most dazzling essays for Esquire, about the subculture of car customizers in Los Angeles, started out as a 49-page memo to Byron Dobell, his editor there, who simply deleted the words ‚Dear Byron‚ at the top of the page and ran it as is. It became the title essay in Mr. Wolfe‚s first collection, ‚The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby,‚ published in 1968.‚Girl of the Year,‚ his 1964 portrait of the Manhattan ‚it‚ girl Baby Jane Holzer, opened with the literary equivalent of a cinematic pan shot at a Rolling Stones concert:‚Bangs manes bouffants beehive Beatle caps butter faces brush-on lashes decal eyes puffy sweaters French thrust bras flailing leather blue jeans stretch pants stretch jeans honey dew bottoms √©clair shanks elf boots ballerinas Knight slippers, hundreds of them these flaming little buds, bobbing and screaming, rocketing around inside the Academy of Music Theater underneath that vast old moldering cherub dome up there ‚ aren‚t they super-marvelous?‚‚Radical Chic‚ SkeweredIn June 1970, New York magazine devoted an entire issue to ‚These Radical Chic Evenings,‚ Mr. Wolfe‚s 20,000-word sendup of a fund-raiser given for the Black Panthers by Leonard Bernstein, the conductor of the New York Philharmonic, and his wife, the Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, in their 13-room Park Avenue penthouse duplex ‚ an affair attended by scores of the Bernsteins‚ liberal, rich and mostly famous friends.‚Do Panthers like little Roquefort cheese morsels rolled on crushed nuts this way, and asparagus tips in mayonnaise dabs, and meatballs petites au Coq Hardi, all of which are at the very moment being offered to them on gadrooned silver platters by maids in black uniforms with hand-ironed white aprons?,‚ Mr. Wolfe wrote, outraging liberals and Panthers alike. When a Time reporter asked a minister for the Black Panthers to comment on the accuracy of Mr. Wolfe‚s account, he said, ‚You mean that dirty, blatant, lying, racist dog who wrote that fascist disgusting thing in New York magazine?‚The article was included in Mr. Wolfe‚s essay collection ‚Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers,‚ published in 1970.Storms did not seem to bother Mr. Wolfe, as his forays into the art world demonstrated. He had always had an interest in art and was indeed an artist himself, sometimes illustrating his work with pen-and-ink drawings. He was a contributing artist at Harper‚s from 1978 to 1981 and exhibited his work on occasion at Manhattan galleries. Many of his illustrations were collected in ‚In Our Time‚ (1980).Earlier, in ‚The Painted Word‚ (1975), he produced a gleeful screed denouncing contemporary art as a con job perpetrated by cultural high priests, notably the critics Clement Greenberg, Harold Rosenberg and Leo Steinberg ‚ ‚the kings of cultureburg,‚ as he called them.The art world, en masse, rejected the argument, and the book, with disdain.‚If someone who is tone-deaf goes to Carnegie Hall every night of the year, he is, of course, entitled to his opinion of what he has listened to, just as a eunuch is entitled to his opinion of sex,‚ the art critic John Russell wrote in The New York Times Book Review.Undeterred, in ‚From Bauhaus to Our House,‚ Mr. Wolfe attacked modern architecture and what he saw as its determination to put dogma before buildings. Published in 1981, it met with the same derisive response from critics. ‚The problem, I think,‚ Paul Goldberger wrote in The Times Book Review, ‚is that Tom Wolfe has no eye.‚Mr. Wolfe‚s later novels earned mixed reviews. Many critics found ‚I Am Charlotte Simmons‚ (2004), about a na√Øve freshman‚s disillusioning experiences at a liberal arts college fueled by sex and alcohol, unconvincing and out of touch. In ‚Back to Blood‚ (2012), Mr. Wolfe created one of his most sympathetic, multidimensional characters in Nestor Camacho, a young Cuban-American police officer trying to navigate the treacherous waters of multiethnic Miami. In the end it was his ear ‚ acute and finely tuned ‚ that served him best and enabled him to write with perfect pitch. And then there was his considerable writing talent.‚There is this about Tom,‚ Mr. Dobell, Mr. Wolfe‚s editor at Esquire, told the London newspaper The Independent in 1998. ‚He has this unique gift of language that sets him apart as Tom Wolfe.

Many of his illustrations were collected in ‚In Our Time‚ (1980).Earlier, in ‚The Painted Word‚ (1975), he produced a gleeful screed denouncing contemporary art as a con job perpetrated by cultural high priests, notably the critics Clement Greenberg, Harold Rosenberg and Leo Steinberg ‚ ‚the kings of cultureburg,‚ as he called them.The art world, en masse, rejected the argument, and the book, with disdain.‚If someone who is tone-deaf goes to Carnegie Hall every night of the year, he is, of course, entitled to his opinion of what he has listened to, just as a eunuch is entitled to his opinion of sex,‚ the art critic John Russell wrote in The New York Times Book Review.Undeterred, in ‚From Bauhaus to Our House,‚ Mr. Wolfe attacked modern architecture and what he saw as its determination to put dogma before buildings. Published in 1981, it met with the same derisive response from critics. ‚The problem, I think,‚ Paul Goldberger wrote in The Times Book Review, ‚is that Tom Wolfe has no eye.‚Mr. Wolfe‚s later novels earned mixed reviews. Many critics found ‚I Am Charlotte Simmons‚ (2004), about a na√Øve freshman‚s disillusioning experiences at a liberal arts college fueled by sex and alcohol, unconvincing and out of touch. In ‚Back to Blood‚ (2012), Mr. Wolfe created one of his most sympathetic, multidimensional characters in Nestor Camacho, a young Cuban-American police officer trying to navigate the treacherous waters of multiethnic Miami. In the end it was his ear ‚ acute and finely tuned ‚ that served him best and enabled him to write with perfect pitch. And then there was his considerable writing talent.‚There is this about Tom,‚ Mr. Dobell, Mr. Wolfe‚s editor at Esquire, told the London newspaper The Independent in 1998. ‚He has this unique gift of language that sets him apart as Tom Wolfe. It is full of hyperbole; it is brilliant; it is funny, and he has a wonderful ear for how people look and feel.‚He has a gift of fluency that pours out of him the way Balzac had it.‚","Tom Wolfe, 88, ‚ÄòNew Journalist‚Äô With Electric Style and Acid Pen, Dies","May 15, 2018 /  3:29 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-tom-wolfe/bonfire-of-the-vanities-author-tom-wolfe-dead-at-88-idUSKCN1IG2DV,"(Reuters) - Tom Wolfe, an early practitioner of “new journalism” who captured the mood and culture of America across five decades with books including “The Bonfire of the Vanities,” “The Right Stuff,” and “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,” has died at the age of 88, his agent said.         Wolfe, who had a knack for coining phrases such as “radical chic” and “the me decade,” died on Monday of an unspecified infection in a New York City hospital, his agent, Lynn Nesbit, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. Wolfe’s works - fiction and non-fiction alike - looked at realms ranging from the art world to Wall Street to 1960s hippie culture and touched on the issues of class, power, race, corruption and sex. “I think every living moment of a human being’s life, unless the person is starving or in immediate danger of death in some other way, is controlled by a concern for status,” Wolfe said in a Wall Street Journal interview. Wolfe came up with “radical chic” to brand pretentious liberals, the “me decade” to sum up the self-indulgence of the 1970s and the “right stuff” to quantify intangible characteristics of the first U.S. astronauts and their test pilot predecessors. He was never deterred by the fact that he often did not fit in with his research subjects, partly because he was such a sartorial dandy, known for his white suits. Wolfe was in his mid-70s while hanging out with college kids and working on the novel “I Am Charlotte Simmons,” and was a fairly conservative drug-free observer in a coat and tie while traveling with Ken Kesey and his LSD-dropping hippie tribe known as The Merry Pranksters for “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” in the ‘60s. By looking so out of place, he figured people would be more prone to explain things to him. ‘NEW JOURNALISM’ Wolfe started his writing career at the Springfield, Massachusetts, Union newspaper and also worked for the Washington Post, New York Herald-Tribune and New York magazine. He was present at the birth of what was known as “new journalism,” a loose style that featured lots of dialogue and detail and allowed reporters to narrate and develop characters in a way more often associated with fiction. One of the genre’s defining moments came when Wolfe was having trouble meeting a deadline for a 1964 magazine story on the hot-rod car culture. In frustration, he sent his editor a letter with his thoughts and reportage. The magazine ran it verbatim as “There Goes (Varoom! Varoom!) That Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby.” That led to a compilation of Wolfe’s magazine pieces, followed by “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,” which captured the spirit of the psychedelic era during his time with Kesey, author of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” and his band of pranksters who helped spread the popularity of LSD in California. Written in a wild free-association style that disregarded rules of punctuation, it was filled with sentence fragments and used words like “skakkkkkkkkkkkkkk” and “wowwwwwww.” Wolfe’s style was not for everyone. “The question is not only whether Tom Wolfe can be taken seriously but whether he can be taken at all,” a Time magazine critic wrote in 1968. “He is irritating, but he did develop a new journalistic idiom that has brought relief from standard Middle-High Journalese.” Wolfe became fascinated with astronauts after Rolling Stone magazine assigned him to cover an Apollo program launch in 1972. Nine years later and in a more restrained style than some of his earlier works, he wrote “The Right Stuff” about the first seven U.S. astronauts and test pilot Chuck Yeager who came before them. His first try at fiction was “The Bonfire of the Vanities” in 1987, which captured the cultural feel of free-wheeling Wall Street “masters of the universe” as well as his non-fiction books did. “Bonfire,” a best-seller that was a much-revised version of a serial he wrote for Rolling Stone, portrayed class struggles in New York City against a backdrop of Wall Street ambition, racial stress and yellow journalism. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that Wolfe’s “wry wit and sharp observations defined an era of life in New York.” Wolfe followed with more novels - “A Man in Full” about race, big money and high society in Atlanta; “I Am Charlotte Simmons,” a tale of college high life, and “Back to Blood” about immigrants in Florida in 2012. Wolfe complained that novelists did not bring enough reality to their books, and while bemoaning the state of American literature, offered himself as an exemplar of what it should be. That kindled rivalries with contemporaries Norman Mailer and John Updike, who Wolfe referred to as “two old piles of bones.” John Irving angrily denounced Wolfe by saying, “I can’t read him because he’s such a bad writer.” Wolfe’s trademark was the white suit, often accessorized with a white hat and two-tone shoes. He admitted he liked the attention they brought him. Wolfe was born March 2, 1930 and grew up in Richmond, Virginia, the son of an agronomist father and an arts-oriented mother. He was a star pitcher in high school and in college at Washington and Lee and unsuccessfully tried out for the New York Giants. Wolfe lived in New York with his wife, Sheila. He had two children.

1004903,72,['2018-05-15t10:00:06.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/technology/uber-sex-misconduct.html,"SAN FRANCISCO ‚ Uber said on Tuesday that it was eliminating forced arbitration agreements for employees, riders and drivers who make sexual assault or harassment claims against the company.Before they could use Uber‚s ride-hailing app, customers have had to consent to a terms-of-service agreement that required them to resolve any legal claims with the company in an arbitration hearing, rather than in open court. Now, customers can take those claims to court, the company said.The decision to yield to pressure from critics who had pushed Uber to forgo the controversial legal practice is the company‚s latest move to improve its badly tarnished image since Dara Khosrowshahi took over as chief executive last August.With hopes for an initial public offering sometime in 2019, Uber is eager to move past a series of scandals that rocked the company over the past year and is trying to distance itself from behavior that prompted a grass-roots campaign urging riders to #DeleteUber. On Monday, Uber started an advertising campaign featuring Mr. Khosrowshahi and a message that the company was ‚moving forward‚ in a new direction.That new direction includes ending the use of forced arbitration agreements. The practice ‚ common to many industries ‚ has been denounced for allowing companies to keep sexual misconduct claims out of the court system and away from public view. Because the claims are kept under wraps in confidential hearings, critics say bad behavior is allowed to perpetuate without warning to future victims.Uber already allows drivers and employees to get out of arbitration agreements, as long as they opt out within the first 30 days of signing a contract with the company. The changes detailed on Tuesday will also eliminate that 30-day requirement.In a blog post, Uber said anyone bringing a sexual assault or harassment claim against the company would not be forced into arbitration and could pursue the matter in court. Uber also did away with a clause requiring people who settle such claims with Uber to sign a nondisclosure agreement that would forbid them from speaking about their experience.‚It‚s important to give sexual assault, and harassment survivors control of how they pursue their claims. So moving forward, survivors will be free to choose to resolve their individual claims in the venue they prefer,‚ wrote Tony West, Uber‚s chief legal officer. ‚They will be free to tell their story wherever and however they see fit.‚ After Uber‚s announcement, its rival Lyft said it would also waive mandatory arbitration agreements around sexual misconduct claims against the company and forgo confidentiality requirements for people who settle claims with Lyft.Uber also said it planned to publish a safety transparency report that would provide data on sexual assaults and other episodes that take place on the ‚Uber platform.‚ That would include rides and deliveries, as well such incidents that happen before pick up or after drop off.The company said it planned to publish the review after it completed a system for reporting incidents. Uber said it hoped to have the system, which it is working on with 80 women‚s groups, in place by the end of the year.In April, 14 women who have accused Uber drivers of sexually assaulting them wrote a letter to the company‚s board, urging it to waive the arbitration agreement and allow them to proceed with a lawsuit in open court. Despite the change in policy, Uber is still not permitting people with individual claims of sexual assault or harassment to take collective action in open court.Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer whose account of harassment and sexism at the company prompted a wide-ranging investigation into the company‚s workplace culture, has also thrown her weight behind legislation in California that would prohibit companies from making arbitration agreements a condition of employment. Ms. Fowler  publicly challenged Mr. Khosrowshahi to scrap the forced arbitration agreements on Twitter.‚These kind of clauses are pretty common, but to have a company come out in front of it and say ‚it‚s not the right thing to do‚ is significant,‚ said Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer for Raliance, an advocacy group working with Uber. In December, Microsoft announced it was eliminating forced arbitration agreements with employees who made sexual assault or harassment claims.In an interview, Mr. West, a former Justice Department official who joined Uber in November, said its new policy applied to people currently in arbitration with Uber over sexual assault of harassment claims.He said waiving of arbitration only applied to those claims and not for other legal claims, like discrimination. Also, Uber will not lift the nondisclosure agreements on people who agreed to remain quiet in past settlements with the company.Mr. West said the company struggled with the decision to commit to a safety transparency report for its rides, because he knows that it will be ‚disturbing‚ when the actual number of assaults that happen on Uber is announced ‚ in part because of the company‚s size and the ease with which customers can report an incident.Also, there is no common terminology in law enforcement for reporting sexual assaults and sometimes the definitions of ‚sexual assault‚ differ from organization to organization, he said.Mr. West said he expected the number of reported assaults to increase in the first six to nine months after reporting the initial figures because ‚people will see that we are paying attention, that we are counting, that we looking to act on this data and that will encourage more reporting.‚",Uber Eliminates Forced Arbitration for Sexual Misconduct Claims,"May 15, 2018 /  10:59 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-sexual-harassment/uber-lyft-scrap-mandatory-arbitration-for-sexual-assault-claims-idUSKCN1IG1I2,"(Reuters) - Ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Lyft Inc scrapped mandatory arbitration to settle sexual harassment or assault claims, giving victims several options to pursue their claims including public lawsuits. Uber’s decision on Tuesday comes after several high-profile scandals and is a step in the right direction, according to several legal experts, but does not address class action lawsuits. Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has unveiled a series of safety measures to restore Uber’s brand and image since taking the top job last August. Victims were previously required to enter into confidentiality agreements as part of arbitration to settle claims, which prevented them from speaking publicly about the facts surrounding any sexual assault or harassment. They can now settle claims through mediation, where they can choose confidentiality; in arbitration, where they can choose to maintain their privacy while pursuing their case; or in court, Uber said in a blog post. ""We commit to publishing a safety transparency report that will include data on sexual assaults and other incidents that occur on the Uber platform,"" Uber's chief legal officer, Tony West, wrote in the blog here “So moving forward, survivors will be free to choose to resolve their individual claims in the venue they prefer.” Lyft also removed the confidentiality requirement for sexual assault victims and ended mandatory arbitration for individuals. “This policy extends to passengers, drivers and Lyft employees,” it said. Jeanne Christensen, a lawyer at Wigdor LLP who has been handling sexual harassment cases against Uber, agreed with the ride-hailing company’s move. “It’s one step toward making a change, but just bringing the issue into the open doesn’t solve the problem,” Christensen told Reuters. Uber did not provide details on the number of sexual harassment cases that are pending or have been settled, but when contacted by Reuters it said it will not revisit past cases that have been settled through the confidentiality agreement. Uber became the second major company to end forced arbitration clauses, after Microsoft Corp said here in December victims would no longer need to settle cases privately. “It is a move in the right direction but the problem is the arbitration agreement prevents class action lawsuit which is essential for a policy change,” said Veena Dubal, associate professor of law at the University of California, Hastings. Uber is currently facing a class action lawsuit in the United States for poor driver vetting that has led to a series of sexual harassment incidents, including rape.

This month, Cambridge Analytica announced that it would shut down and declare bankruptcy, saying that negative press and cascading federal and state investigations had driven away customers and made it impossible for the firm to remain in business.Cambridge Analytica, the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment. The company, whose principal owner is the wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer, offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Its so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned Cambridge‚s work for the Trump campaign in 2016.But the firm found itself at the center of a trans-Atlantic furor after the Times and Observer articles appeared. It was then dealt another blow when a British news channel broadcast undercover video in which Alexander Nix, the company‚s suspended chief executive, suggested that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections.The federal investigation in the United States appears to focus on the company‚s financial dealings ‚ investigators have reached out to the company‚s banks, for instance ‚ and how it acquired and used personal data pulled from Facebook and other sources, according to the American official, who was briefed on the inquiry, and other people familiar with it.In addition, the investigators have contacted Facebook, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation. The official would not provide any other details, and Facebook declined to comment.In a sign of the inquiry‚s scope, one of the prosecutors involved is the assistant chief of the Justice Department‚s securities and financial fraud division, Brian Kidd. The effort is being assisted by at least one agent who investigates cybercrime for the F.B.I., those people said. Mr. Kidd traveled to London this month with another Justice Department prosecutor and an F.B.I. agent to interview Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee who has emerged as one of the firm‚s fiercest critics.‚I can confirm that I‚ve been contacted by the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice, and answered preliminary questions,‚ Mr. Wylie said in a brief interview. ‚We plan to meet again to provide substantive answers to the investigators.‚ It was not clear whether the investigation is tied to the inquiry being led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who is examining whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates aided Russia‚s effort to interfere in the presidential election. Prosecutors from Mr. Mueller‚s team questioned at least two Cambridge executives last December in Washington, according to one company official.The employee, who asked to remain anonymous to describe confidential internal matters, added that the inquiry appeared to be perfunctory. There have been no other concrete signs from Mr. Mueller‚s team that Cambridge is a focus of their efforts.The Justice Department‚s investigation is running parallel to a separate investigation by the National Crime Agency of Britain. There, investigators are examining a range of allegations, including whether Cambridge Analytica employees sought to bribe foreign officials, destroyed evidence, hacked computers and violated Britain‚s Data Protection Act.Mr. Wylie said he had been cooperating with the National Crime Agency. He has also provided testimony and internal Cambridge Analytica documents to Parliament. ‚There is an international investigation being coordinated by the National Crime Agency in Britain, and I intend to be as helpful and cooperative as I can,‚ he said.Cambridge Analytica has denied using Facebook data on the 2016 campaign. An internal audit commissioned by Cambridge described Mr. Nix‚s statements in the video as an exaggeration.Cambridge Analytica grew out of the SCL Group, a well-established British company that specialized in psychological research for defense and intelligence agencies but also worked on election campaigns, chiefly in developing countries.In 2014, SCL executives persuaded Mr. Mercer to bankroll a new United States-based firm, Cambridge Analytica, that would break into the growing political data market with a promising new product: psychological profiles of millions of American voters. The new company was overseen by Mr. Mercer‚s daughter, Rebekah, and then adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, both of whom went on to enjoy influential positions in Mr. Trump‚s circle before the president‚s break with Mr. Bannon this year.Also in 2014, a contractor for the new firm used quiz apps and other programs to gather private profile information from as many as 87 million Facebook users, data former Cambridge employees said provided the critical basis for the new company‚s voter profiles. The Times also reported in March that the company had sent personnel from Canada and Europe to work on various campaigns in the 2014 midterm elections and in 2016 campaigns, raising questions about Cambridge‚s compliance with federal election law, which limits the involvement of noncitizens in election campaigns.Over the past year, Cambridge‚s efforts to break into commercial data and marketing work had suffered from the company‚s association with Mr. Trump, according to former employees. And in the months before shutting down, Mr. Nix, the Mercer family and SCL‚s owners had considered new ventures together.One new firm, a British holding company called Emerdata, was formed in part to bring in new investors, according to a former employee. Emerdata‚s directors, according to public records, came to include Johnson Ko Chun Shun, a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince, founder of the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater.Mr. Ko and Mr. Prince have links to the Chinese government: Citic, a state-owned Chinese financial conglomerate that for decades has employed the sons and daughters of the Communist Party‚s elite families, is a major investor in Frontier Services Group, Mr. Ko and Mr. Prince‚s Africa-focused logistics company.",Justice Department and F.B.I.

Prosecutors have sought to question former Cambridge Analytica employees and banks that handled its business, the newspaper said, citing an American official and others familiar with the inquiry,  Cambridge Analytica said earlier this month it was shutting down after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014. Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump’s 2016 U.S. election campaign, have prompted multiple investigations in the United States and Europe. The investigation by the Justice Department and FBI appears to focus on the company’s financial dealings and how it acquired and used personal data pulled from Facebook and other sources, the Times said. Investigators have contacted Facebook, according to the newspaper. The FBI, the Justice Department and Facebook declined to comment to Reuters. Former officials with Cambridge Analytica was not immediately available to comment. Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013, initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times has reported. Bannon left the White House on August 2017.

Female candidates showed strength in nearly every region of Pennsylvania, from the Philadelphia suburbs to the conservative southwest.Madeleine Dean, the state House member; Chrissy Houlahan, the veteran; and Mary Gay Scanlon, one of the lawyers, each won in Philadelphia suburban districts that they are now favored to carry in November, according to results from The Associated Press. Their primary victories raise the likelihood of women cracking the state‚s all-male congressional delegation.Susan Wild, the other lawyer, won a competitive primary in the Lehigh Valley but now faces a tough general election race in a district with many blue-collar voters. The women won in districts that were redrawn to replace a gerrymandered Republican map that the State Supreme Court ruled illegal in January. The new map of the state‚s 18 House districts ‚ and the ebullience it set off among Democrats hoping to capture the House of Representatives in the midterms ‚ put Pennsylvania front-and-center among four states that held primaries on Tuesday.President Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania in 2016 and Democrats, seeking to tap into grass-roots rejection of the president, badly want a version of a do-over in the midterm elections. And the state will be critical to determining whether Republicans or Democrats win control of the House in November.Nationwide, Democrats need to flip two dozen Republican-held seats to gain a majority in the House. Under the new congressional map, Democrats have a shot at flipping at least three and possibly as many as six seats this fall in the Keystone State, most in a collar of counties around Philadelphia. Redistricting recognized the shifting demographics that have remade the region from a once-solid Republican enclave. But the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party‚s chief spending arm, is not easily ceding races in the suburbs. The committee has reserved $7.8 million in television advertising for the fall in the Philadelphia market, a spokesman confirmed Tuesday, its largest early spending commitment of any region nationally.Most of the money will be aimed at two competitive districts north of Philadelphia that are considered tossup races this fall; both have been Republican-held, but Democrats believe they have a shot at winning them.In one, centered on Bucks County, first-term Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican, will face Scott Wallace, a millionaire who outspent a rival 16-to-1.Republicans are expected to attack Mr. Wallace as a carpetbagger who only moved back to the district last year from Maryland and has not voted there in decades.Though Mr. Fitzpatrick is vulnerable after just a single term, he succeeded his brother in the seat, so his name is known to voters in a district Hillary Clinton narrowly won in 2016.The other district that will be a November battleground is Ms. Wild‚s race. The first female solicitor of Allentown, Ms. Wild defeated primary rivals to her right and her left: Greg Edwards, who had been endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and John Morganelli, a district attorney who tweeted after that presidential election of 2016 that he would like a job with the Trump administration. Ms. Dean was the winner in a suburban district in Montgomery County considered a safe Democratic seat after redistricting. Ms. Houlahan had the good fortune of being the only Democrat running in a district almost as safe, centered in Chester County, which Mrs. Clinton won two years ago by nine percentage points. And Ms. Scanlon prevailed in a Democratic primary field that included five other women ‚ the largest number of female Democrats in any congressional primary race in the nation this year. The House races were the centerpiece, but not the only show in Pennsylvania. In two important statewide primaries for the right to challenge Democratic incumbents ‚ for governor and the United States Senate ‚ the favorites carried the day.Lou Barletta, a congressman from Luzerne County, who made a reputation on unflinching opposition to illegal immigrants and became an early supporter of Mr. Trump, won the Republican nomination to challenge Senator Bob Casey Jr., a mild-mannered politician who has become a relentless critic of Mr. Trump.And Scott Wagner, a state senator whose fortune from waste hauling led to an inevitable campaign slogan that he would be Pennsylvania‚s ‚cleanup guy,‚ won the nomination to challenge Gov. Tom Wolf.Mr. Wagner and Mr. Wolf are ideological opposites. Their fall race is expected to include fierce disagreement over Mr. Wagner‚s support of anti-union ‚right to work‚ legislation, in a state where organized labor remains strong. Mr. Wolf opposes the legislation. Mr. Wagner beat Paul Mango, a former health care consultant and West Point graduate, in one of the nastiest primaries the state has seen. Mr. Mango attacked Mr. Wagner over a protective order a daughter once obtained against him, which prompted a response ad by the daughter in which she angrily defended her father.In an unusual down-ballot race, Lt. Gov. Mike Stack, a Democrat who had a falling out with Governor Wolf, lost to a primary challenger, John Fetterman, the mayor of Braddock. Mr. Stack was in the news last year after accusations he mistreated State Police in his protective detail.And in the southwest corner of the state, State Senator Guy Reschenthaler defeated State Representative Rick Saccone, who previously lost a widely watched special election to Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat, in a region that had strongly backed Mr. Trump.Idaho, Oregon and Nebraska also went to the polls on Tuesday. In Nebraska, the Democrat Jane Raybould, a city councilwoman in Lincoln, won the primary and will face Senator Deb Fischer, a Republican seeking her second term in a comfortably red state.Knute Buehler, a member of the Oregon House of Representatives, won the Republican nomination for governor in the state, easily prevailing over nine other candidates. He will face the incumbent Democrat, Kate Brown.",Pennsylvania Primaries Deliver Strong Wins for Democratic Women,"May 15, 2018 /  10:04 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election/key-u-s-house-battleground-forged-in-pennsylvania-idUSKCN1IG1BL,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats’ quest to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives and stymie President Donald Trump’s agenda began in earnest on Tuesday after voters in Pennsylvania chose a slate of nominees to compete in a pivotal battleground state. Democrats must wrest 23 seats nationwide from Republicans to take over the House, and analysts say the party could gain as many as five seats in Pennsylvania alone in the general congressional election in November.  The most closely watched race was in the district around Allentown, Pennsylvania, where a bevy of Democrats battled to replace incumbent U.S. Representative Charlie Dent, one of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the House.  The Democratic field in that contest was viewed as a conflict between the progressive and centrist wings of a party still trying to find its footing in the Trump Era.  As it turned out, the most traditional Democrat in the race, Susan Wild, who was endorsed by the influential advocacy group Emily’s List, won the nomination, narrowly edging moderate John Morganelli, who opposes abortion rights. The liberal political-action group NextGen America, backed by activist Tom Steyer, worked to defeat Morganelli and said in a statement that Wild’s victory showed Democrats that “to win elections, we don’t need to moderate our vision or accept compromise on our fundamental values”. Scott Wallace won the nomination in another district northeast of Philadelphia that Democrats hope to turn. Wallace will face vulnerable Republican incumbent Representative Brian Fitzpatrick.    Democrats are also expected to win three contests in districts in suburban Philadelphia that have been redrawn to favor them.

REUTERS/Mark MakelaMadeleine Dean, a state representative, Air Force veteran Chrissy Houlahan and lawyer Mary Gay Scanlon won the nomination in their respective districts. Currently, there are no women representing Pennsylvania in the House.  Pennsylvania’s politics were thrown into turmoil this year when the state Supreme Court found that its congressional districts had been unconstitutionally tailored to favor Republicans. The redrawn map has made some districts more competitive. In addition, six incumbent House Republicans are not running for re-election, further scrambling the races and requiring voters to become familiar with a raft of first-time candidates.  As for the Senate, U.S. Representative Lou Barletta won the Republican nomination to battle incumbent Democrat Bob Casey in the fall. Barletta was an early supporter of Trump’s presidential bid and has fervently embraced the president’s policies.  Democrats must hold Casey’s Senate seat and those of other incumbents and pick up two currently held by Republicans to seize control of that chamber.  Beyond Pennsylvania, Democratic hopes of taking a Nebraska House seat might have been dealt a blow after progressive Kara Eastman won a primary race against former congressman Brad Ashford, who was backed by the national party.

Residents look at an Army vehicle which was damaged during battle between Afghan security forces and Taliban in Farah province, Afghanistan May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer  With security heightened to protect preparations for elections in October, the fighting underlined the problems faced by President Ashraf Ghani’s government, which has struggled to rein in the insurgency in the provinces and ensure security against suicide attacks in Kabul. Afghan and U.S. officials said the Taliban fighters who attacked Farah on Tuesday had been driven out, but officials in Ghazni, on the other side of the country, said the insurgents were attacking in three districts and a key highway link, blocked for almost two weeks, remained severed. Since the Taliban announced the start of their annual spring offensive last month, they have seized or threatened district centers in Baghlan and Badakhshan provinces in the northeast, Faryab in the northwest and Ghazni and Zabul south of Kabul. Fighters overran a number of areas in Tuesday’s early morning assault on Farah, raising fears of a repeat of their capture of the northern city of Kunduz in 2015. On Wednesday, defense ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said Farah was completely under government control, with some fighting continuing in outlying areas, though the city still bore the scars of Tuesday’s fierce fighting. “The Taliban burnt parts of the headquarters of the National Directorate of Security and the customs office, and according to my information, they reached the central provincial prison as well,” said Farid Haibat, a Farah civil activist. Afghan forces were backed by U.S. air power and several drone strikes were conducted overnight but the Taliban denied having been pushed back, saying fighters pulled out after achieving their objectives of creating shock and capturing weapons and equipment. “Without any disturbance, the mujahideen withdrew to their safe positions,” Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said in a statement, employing a term the Taliban uses for its fighters. In Ghazni, where Taliban fighters have cut a key highway link with the neighboring province of Paktia for the past two weeks, fighters pressed a number of district centers. Taliban fighters attacked the district of Zanakhan, just north of the city, district governor Zia Yaqoubi said, killing 13 police on Tuesday and capturing weapons and ammunition. The districts of Gero and Andar to the southeast were also attacked. “There is no way of supplying Andar by road, so it has to be supplied by air,” said provincial council member Ahmad Faqiri. “If the district doesn’t get supplies and reinforcements, there will be a disaster.” Reporting by Qadir Sediqi and James Mackenzie in KABUL, Mustafa Andalib in GHAZNI, Storay Karimi in HERAT and Abdul Malik in LASHKAR GAH; Editing by Clarence FernandezOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Afghan fighting continues as Taliban cleared from western city,Y

NO ARCHIVE.Residents of the city, capital of Farah province on the border with Iran, have warned for months the city was vulnerable and the attack threatened a repeat of the Taliban’s capture of the northern city of Kunduz in 2015. Local people said Taliban forces began their attack at around 2.00 a.m. (2130 GMT Monday) from several directions and a senior official said the situation was serious early in the day as the insurgents overran several areas and the provincial governor left the city. However, as special forces units, backed by both Afghan and U.S. air strikes rushed to counter the assault, the situation stabilized later in the day. Mohammad Radmanish, a spokesman for the defense ministry in Kabul, said the insurgents had been pushed out of the city and reinforcements, including special forces units from neighboring provinces, had been ordered to Farah. The NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Kabul said U.S. A-10 attack aircraft were also supporting Afghan forces and there had been at least one drone strike, while Afghan air force A-29s and Mi-17 helicopters had conducted multiple attacks. “Farah city remains under government control, and the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, supported by U.S. Forces-Afghanistan airpower, are on the offensive against the Taliban,” spokesman Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell said.   However the speed of the attack, which saw large parts of the city including police headquarters and the governor’s compound under siege at different times, caused shock among residents. “The Taliban are moving very fast, if the government does not take serious and speedy action, the province is going to collapse to Taliban,” said Hamidullah, a resident of the city reached by telephone in the morning. The attack adds to the problems facing President Ashraf Ghani’s government, which has come under increasing public pressure over worsening security ahead of parliamentary elections due in October. There were no detailed casualty assessments but a Resolute Support spokesman said dozens of Taliban fighters had been killed and there had also been an unspecified number of casualties on the government side. In one incident, at least 18 soldiers were killed by a suicide bomber in the Askarabad area of the city, Farid Bakhtawar, head of a provincial council said. However, Radmanish said only two soldiers were killed in the blast.

NO ARCHIVESNEW U.S. STRATEGY Farah province, a remote and sparsely populated area, has seen months of heavy fighting, with hundreds of police and soldiers killed and severe losses inflicted even on elite special forces units. Residents have warned repeatedly that the provincial capital was under threat. “Farah is in dire need of air support,” Dadullah Qane, a provincial council member, said by telephone as the fighting went on in the morning. “The Taliban are well equipped with heavy arms and night vision equipment.” Tuesday’s assault adds to the growing number of crisis points around Afghanistan since the Taliban began their annual spring offensive last month, including a series of deadly suicide attacks in the capital, Kabul. District centers have been lost or threatened in the northern provinces of Baghlan and Badakhshan and there has been heavy fighting in Faryab in the northwest and Ghazni and Zabul, south of Kabul. Although the insurgents have been unable to take and hold any provincial center, they are active across Afghanistan and the government has firm control over no more than 56 percent of the country, according to U.S. estimates. The United States has boosted its assistance to the government under a new strategy announced by President Donald Trump last year, sending thousands of additional troops and advisers and stepping up air strikes to support Afghan forces. Farah, which also borders the opium-rich Taliban heartland of Helmand province, has key smuggling routes into Iran. Hundreds of fighters have moved there as U.S. and Afghan forces have stepped up operations in Helmand. As the fighting raged on Tuesday, Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi warned civilians to remain in their houses. “Mujahideen have nothing to do with civilians, only military positions are the target,” he said in a statement, referring to Taliban fighters. Residents said shops, schools and government offices were closed and the Taliban had set up posts around the city and were checking identity cards and preventing people from fleeing.

Residents look at an Army vehicle which was damaged during battle between Afghan security forces and Taliban in Farah province, Afghanistan May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer  The heavily armed fighters had gone to ground in residential areas following their surprise attack on Tuesday, when they nearly overran Farah, before Afghan troops backed by U.S. air power fought them off. “From one side, there were Taliban and from the other side, war planes firing from the air. People were terrified,” said city shopkeeper Qudratullah. The Taliban fighters emerged from their hiding places about an hour before midnight on Wednesday, some of them firing on security forces from rooftops, with gunbattles raging into the early hours of Thursday.  At least one suicide bomb attack was launched near the city’s police headquarters. “The city has been turned into a military zone, people are worried and shops are closed,” said resident Baz Mohammad. “After what happened last night, anything can happen any time.” Schools were also declared closed for the whole of the month of Ramadan, which began on Thursday, because of the security situation, said Kabir Haqmal, media advisor to the ministry of education. After months of relative calm over the winter, the latest fighting underlines the challenge facing the Kabul government and its U.S. allies who are struggling to contain the Taliban insurgency. The United States has sent thousands of extra trainers to help Afghan forces and stepped up air strikes dramatically, with the aim of pressing the Taliban to the negotiating table, but there has been little to indicate the plan is working. BLAMING IRAN In Farah, U.S. forces have provided air support with A-10 attack aircraft and pilotless drones, while the Afghan air force has conducted numerous strikes with its own helicopters and A-29 ground attack aircraft. Officials had earlier said the city was clear of Taliban but confirmed the fighting overnight. “A number of Taliban clashed with Afghan forces in different parts of the city,” said Fazel Ahmad Sherzad, the city’s police chief.  “Right now there is no fighting but a search and clearance operation is underway,” he said. He said a number of foreign fighters appeared to be operating with the Taliban but there was no way of independently verifying that. Officials in Farah often blame neighboring Iran for helping the Taliban in the area. Fighting has increased across Afghanistan in recent weeks with government forces under heavy pressure in provinces including Badakhshan, Baghlan and Faryab in the north, Farah in the west and Zabul and Ghazni south of the capital Kabul. In addition, Kabul itself has been targeted by a wave of suicide attacks that have killed and wounded hundreds of people since the beginning of the year.

Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim speaks to Reuters during an interview at his house in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia May 17, 2018. REUTERS/StringerNajib was handed a shocking election loss last week which ended the dominance of the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled Malaysia for more than six decades. BN’s defeat in the May 9 polls was attributed to rising anger over corruption and an unlikely alliance struck between 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad and his former rival, Anwar, who got together to oust the scandal-tainted Najib. Anwar, who was pardoned and released from his five-year jail term for sodomy on Wednesday, said he had received two calls from Najib. “When he called on the night of the election, I advised him as a friend to concede and move on,” Anwar told Reuters in an interview at his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. Anwar said he asked Najib to come out with a statement quickly rather than delay and be perceived as trying to scuttle the process.  Najib, however, said nothing despite Mahathir declaring victory a few hours after the counting of the votes began. At a news conference the next day, Najib said no party had a simple majority and the constitutional monarch would decide who would form the government. “He was just very evasive ... he refused to concede early,” Anwar said about his discussion on election night.  He said Najib was thinking of what he could do and who he could consult. But Anwar insisted the former-PM did not approach him for a deal in any “serious manner”.  “Even if he had referred to that (a deal) I would have just ignored ... I was just listening to him,” Anwar said when asked if Najib had offered him a deal to shift allegiance. “After the second call he was totally shattered,” he said. Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim speaks to Reuters during an interview at his house in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia May 17, 2018. REUTERS/StringerNajib could not immediately be reached for comment. “In a close contest between two coalitions it is not unusual for a leader of the losing team to try to entice members from the other side,” said Adib Zalkapli, a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst with risk consultancy Vriens & Partners. Khairy Jamaluddin, the youth and sports minister in Najib’s government, visited Najib at his house on election night and said this week the prime minister had been “calm” and “poised”, but that the people around him were “stunned, shocked and somber”. Khairy was not available for comment on Thursday. A spokesman for Khairy declined to comment on Anwar’s description of events on election night.    Najib’s coalition secured only 79 of Malaysia’s 222 parliamentary seats while Anwar’s People’s Justice Party (PKR) won 50 seats. An alliance between the two could have secured Najib’s return to power. Last year, Najib visited Anwar at a hospital where he was recovering from a shoulder surgery. The meeting sparked rumors that the two leaders may strike up an agreement to join forces against Mahathir, although this was quickly dismissed by Anwar’s team. RIGHT MAN Mahathir, who was sworn in as leader last Thursday, secured a royal pardon for Anwar, and has promised to step aside for his friend-turned-foe-turned-ally to become prime minister. The relationship between these two giants of Malaysian politics is a saga that has spanned three decades. Anwar said it had been accepted that he would be the next prime minister after Mahathir steps down, but he wanted to ensure a smooth transition. Slideshow (3 Images)“Mahathir has been in power for just a week so it’s not proper to talk about an immediate transition. So let him just continue,” Anwar said. He did not give a time frame for this move. Anwar was Mahathir’s deputy in the 1990s, but fell out with his mentor during the 1997-99 Asian financial crisis. He was eventually sacked from the ruling party and founded the Reformasi (Reform) movement, challenging Mahathir’s government. Within weeks, he was arrested and jailed on disputed charges of sodomy and corruption. After being freed in 2004, Anwar was jailed a second time for sodomy in 2015, when Najib was in power. Both times, he and his supporters said the charges were politically motivated. Mahathir was perfect as prime minister right now as the new government goes about dismantling the obsolete and corrupt system put in place by the long-ruling United Malay National Organisation (UMNO)-led coalition, Anwar said. UMNO’s race-based politics and patronage system has been slammed by its critics and blamed for the bulging civil service and weak institutions like the judiciary.  “Probably he seems to be the right man...I am a bit more moderate and have a softer image,” Anwar said. “Because of how I suffered, I always think how any decision would cause sufferings to those affected. So I’m a bit more considerate...and that may not be good in these times when we have to make sure the elements of the old regime do not resurface.” Anwar and his party has faced a protracted struggle to gain power due to electoral systems and government institutions working in favor of the ruling party.  He said the old regime had been dismantled, but the new government could not assume it would retain the level of support and euphoria seen in the last week. “From my discussion with the PM (Mahathir) this morning, that seems to be the sentiment ... we will have to deliver,” he said. “I have given that message. We don’t want UMNO 2.0.” Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Nick MacfieOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Exclusive: Malaysia's Anwar says 'shattered' Najib called him twice on election night,Y

The medicine, used to treat an aggressive form of the disease, is credited with saving many lives, but it also has some tough side effects, particularly damage to the heart.A large new study that followed thousands of women with early-stage breast cancer for a median of more than five years has found that those treated with Herceptin for only six months did just as well as those who got it for a year ‚ and they suffered fewer side effects.The shorter regimen also saved money. A yearlong course of the drug costs $76,700.Dr. Bruce E. Johnson, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said the study‚s findings should change treatment for women who have early-stage breast cancer treatable by Herceptin. He was not involved in the research, which was done in Britain and will be presented at a meeting of the oncology society next month.‚A lot of people will likely adopt a shorter regimen based on this finding,‚ Dr. Johnson said.Cancer specialists say the study offers not only important news for women‚s health, but also highlights a type of research that pharmaceutical companies almost never do and that is also critically important for cancer drugs that can often be quite toxic. The study has not yet been published in a medical journal, and some experts reserved judgment until the data have been peer-reviewed.Dr. Johnson noted that as the field of cancer research matures, more efforts are being made to fine-tune treatments ‚ lessening doses or duration, or even dropping some forms of therapy entirely for certain patients ‚ to minimize harsh side effects without sacrificing efficacy.For example, a study last year showed that many patients with colon cancer could safely shorten their course of chemotherapy from six months to three. And a study in 2016 found that many women with early-stage breast cancer, who traditionally would have been given chemo, could safely skip it, based on tests of gene activity in their tumors.Dr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer of the American Cancer Society, said there was also an increasing recognition among doctors that it is safe to monitor some early cancers, including certain tumors in the prostate, thyroid gland, kidney and bladder, rather than perform surgery immediately. Some tumors will eventually require removal, but others will not grow, spread or threaten the patient‚s life or health.The Herceptin study was paid for by the British government. Dr. Johnson said that although drug companies finance many studies, they are not eager to pay for research that may decrease use of their products. Dr. Brawley agreed, saying: ‚When drug companies do research, they‚re interested in gaining knowledge such that they can make money for their shareholders. There is a difference. You will not see drug companies doing this kind of study. They don‚t mind that somebody else did it, but they will not get caught doing a study that decreases their bottom line.‚Courtney Aberbach, a spokeswoman for Herceptin‚s maker, Genentech, owned by Roche, said in an email that previous studies had not found that a shorter duration worked as well as the longer one.She said the 12-month course was still the only regimen approved for early-stage disease by the Food and Drug Administration and recommended by several international organizations that issue treatment guidelines.But Dr. Brawley pointed out that this type of research underlines the importance of government entities in conducting or supporting cancer research, because their goal is to increase understanding of the disease.The new study is the first to show that women with early-stage disease can safely cut back on Herceptin, Dr. Helena Earl, its first author, at the University of Cambridge in Britain, said in an email.‚Here we are asking the question whether less is more,‚ she said.Studies like the new one, aimed at finding out whether one treatment is no worse than another, are more difficult and more expensive ‚ requiring more patients and longer follow-up ‚ than studies trying to prove that one treatment is better than another, Dr. Brawley said.About 15 percent of women with early breast cancer have tumors that respond to Herceptin, also called trastuzumab. Such tumors are particularly aggressive, because they have high levels of a protein called HER2, which promotes cancer growth. The drug significantly increases survival in those women. But it has risks as well, particularly heart problems, which are sometimes permanent.‚I have personally seen congestive heart failure caused by Herceptin,‚ Dr. Brawley said. ‚The longer you give it, the likelier they are to get it. So it‚s a wonderful thing if you can give it for a shorter time.‚In the United States, 266,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected in 2018, and nearly 41,000 deaths. Globally, the most recent statistics come from 2012, when there were 1.7 million new cases.The women in the study had early-stage breast cancer, meaning it had not spread to bones or organs ‚ stages 1, 2 and 3. The findings do not apply to women with more advanced disease that has spread, Stage 4. Those patients need a longer course of treatment, Dr. Earl said.She said the findings would undergo ‚rigorous scientific scrutiny‚ by other researchers and be published in a peer-reviewed journal.In addition, the results will be analyzed further to determine whether there are subgroups of patients with specific levels of risk that would signal different advice about Herceptin.‚The final call will be with our colleagues and patients to decide whether these results will change practice,‚ Dr. Earl said.‚This could be absolutely practice-changing for a lot of patients,‚ said Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. But she added, ‚I‚d like to see the data, and see it peer-reviewed, before I make a big practice change.‚In the meantime, the results should reassure women who in the past had to quit Herceptin after only six months because of side effects, Dr. Litton said.She had a patient like that whom she had worried about. ‚Now I don‚t feel bad,‚ Dr. Litton said.Dr. Earl‚s study, called the Persephone trial, included 4,089 women in Britain who were picked at random to take the drug for six or 12 months, along with standard chemotherapy. The women were 23 to 82 years old, with a median age of 56. They were followed for a median of more than five years.After four years, the disease-free survival rate was 89.4 percent in those treated for six months, and 89.8 percent in the 12-month group.Disease-free survival means they had no signs of breast cancer, and the lack of difference between the two groups suggests that their overall survival should be equal as well, Dr. Johnson said, though longer follow-up would be needed to be sure.Dr. Earl said they would be followed for 10 years.Toxicity can build up over time, and with the shorter course, half as many women had to quit treatment early because of heart problems: 4 percent in the six-month group, versus 8 percent in the 12-month group.Earlier studies that proved Herceptin‚s effectiveness treated patients for a year, a somewhat arbitrary duration, but one that became the standard of care because there was data to support it.To change that standard, researchers had to produce evidence that it could be safely done. Dr. Earl‚s study is the first step in that direction.",Good News on Early Breast Cancer: Herceptin Treatment Can Be Shortened,"June 13, 2018 /  5:22 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-breast/race-may-be-factor-in-who-completes-breast-cancer-chemotherapy-idUSKBN1J92K2,"(Reuters Health) - White women with breast cancer are more likely to complete their prescribed chemotherapy regimen than women of color, a U.S. study suggests. Just 50 percent of non-white women in the study finished all of their prescribed treatments, compared with 76 percent of white women, researchers found.  The study included 124 women prescribed so-called neoadjuvant chemotherapy, treatment often recommended before surgery for patients with larger cancers because it can shrink tumors and allow for less extensive operations. Overall, 92 women, or 74 percent, completed their neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After accounting for factors like age, insurance status and tumor size, white women were more than three times as likely to finish neoadjuvant chemotherapy as black, Hispanic and Asian women. “There is no clear explanation available for how race affects completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,” said senior researcher Dr. Shayna Lefrak Showalter of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville. She and her colleagues note in the journal Surgery that racial disparities in outcomes for Americans with breast cancer and other malignancies have been attributed to multiple factors. These include different tumor biology, less frequent screening, less aggressive treatment and failure to seek medical care and follow-up treatment.  In this study, “For both white and non-white patients, the most common reason given for stopping treatment early was drug toxicity,” Showalter said by email. “In order for patients to receive maximum benefit from therapy, it is important for them to complete the prescribed dose.” More than half of the women who stopped treatment early cited side effects, most often neurological problems or pain for women of color and gastrointestinal issues for white women. Some patients also discontinued treatment because of cancer progression, psychological or social issues, or personal beliefs. Non-white patients were more likely to have larger tumors before chemotherapy and more likely to have insurance through government health programs like Medicaid, but these factors didn’t appear to influence the likelihood of completing treatment. There also wasn’t a difference in the types of treatment regimens prescribed to white and non-white patients that could help explain the likelihood of completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. One goal of neoadjuvant treatment is to increase the chance that women will be able to have a lumpectomy, or breast-conserving surgery, instead of a mastectomy that removes the entire breast. Completion of neoadjuvant treatment didn’t appear to influence the chance that women would get a lumpectomy, however.  Another goal is to make it more likely that women will experience what’s known as a pathologic complete response (pCR), when no tumor remains after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, because this is linked to better survival odds. But this outcome also didn’t appear to be influenced by whether women finished all of their prescribed treatments.  “Our main concern would be that incomplete neoadjuvant chemotherapy could lead to lower rates of pCR or breast conserving surgery (i.e. lumpectomy),” said Erica Warner, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study. “This study did not find differences in breast surgery or pCR between those that completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and those that didn’t,” Warner said by email. The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or why race might influence the odds of completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It was also too small and brief to shed any light on survival odds, and included only 38 non-white patients. “The numbers are too small to draw any conclusions, and most patients who stopped treatment early stopped for toxicity,” said Dr. Rachel Freedman, a disparities researcher at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “For me, this study points out how we need to better address toxicity in patients rather than focusing on disparities,” Freedman said by email.

Such tumors are particularly aggressive, because they have high levels of a protein called HER2, which promotes cancer growth. The drug significantly increases survival in those women. But it has risks as well, particularly heart problems, which are sometimes permanent.‚I have personally seen congestive heart failure caused by Herceptin,‚ Dr. Brawley said. ‚The longer you give it, the likelier they are to get it.

Herceptin, a biotech medicine that costs around $76,700 a year in the United States, generated 2017 worldwide sales of more than $7 billion for Roche. If a shorter treatment duration is widely adopted it could significantly reduce sales.  Halving treatment duration reduces the number of people who have to quit therapy due to side effects and “obviously will have an effect on cost as well,” Dr. Bruce Johnson, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), said during a conference call with reporters. He added that patients in the study need to be followed to see how they fare longer term. Roche, in an emailed statement, said other studies have not shown that a shorter treatment duration works as well as 12 months, and emphasized that use of Herceptin for one year is the only FDA-approved indication for HER2-positive early breast cancer. The Herceptin trial is one of thousands of cancer drug studies set to be presented at ASCO’s annual meeting next month in Chicago. Brief summaries of many of them were released on Wednesday.  Herceptin, first approved in 2005, is used for cancer patients whose tumors generate a protein called HER2, which accounts for about 25 percent of breast cancer cases. About 15 percent are early-stage HER2 disease. The injected drug, known chemically as trastuzumab, can cause serious side effects, including heart failure. The 4,089-patient study, funded by Britain’s National Institute for Health Research, found that after surgery 89.4 percent of patients given six months of Herceptin were alive with no signs of cancer four years later, compared with 89.8 percent of women treated for 12 months. In addition, four percent of women in the six-month group stopped treatment because of heart problems, compared with eight percent in the 12-month group. “We are confident that this will mark the first steps towards a reduction in treatment duration for many women with HER2-positive breast cancer,” said Dr. Helena Earl, the study’s lead investigator and professor of clinical cancer medicine at the University of Cambridge. Research is continuing to determine the impact of treatment length on quality of life as well as to define which patients are best suited for less treatment, Dr. Earl said. Dr. Richard Schilsky, ASCO’s chief medical officer, said the study follow-up is still relatively short, but the results “likely will signal a shift, even in the U.S. oncology community, toward shorter duration of trastuzumab (post surgery)therapy.” Reporting By Deena Beasley; Editing by Bill BerkrotOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Roche breast cancer drug treatment time can be halved - study,W

Researchers studied 19,541 participants in the federally funded Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) who were randomly selected to join a dietary experiment focused on limiting fat intake to 20 percent of calories. Researchers also looked at data for a control group of 29,294 women in the WHI study who didn’t alter their diets.  By the time the researchers had been tracking half the women for at least 8.5 years, 1,764 participants had been diagnosed with breast cancer.  A decade after their diagnosis, 82 percent of the breast cancer patients on the low-fat diet were still alive, compared with 78 percent in the control group.  For women on the low-fat diet who developed breast cancer, this translated into a 22 percent lower risk of death during the study, and these women typically didn’t succeed at reducing fat consumption by the amount suggested in the diet experiment.  “Decades ago, comparison of country-to-country differences in fat intake found countries with higher fat intake like the U.S. and most of Western Europe had higher breast cancer mortality, but subsequent observational studies have had inconsistent results,” said lead study author Dr. Rowan Chlebowski of City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California. The WHI dietary modification trial is the only full-scale randomized trial addressing this issue,” Chlebowski said by email.  The main goal of the diet experiment was to get women to change their eating habits, not to count calories or lose weight.  Women assigned to change their diets had a series of group and individual counseling sessions with certified nutritionists over the first year of the program, followed by group sessions four times a year for the remainder of the experiment.  After one year, women in the diet group got about 24 percent of their calories from fat compared with 35 percent fat in other participants’ diets. While weight loss wasn’t a goal, women in the diet group weighted about 2.2 kilograms (4.9 pounds) less than other participants.  While the diet experiment was ongoing, 671 women in the diet group and 1,093 who didn’t alter their eating habits developed breast cancer. This difference was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.  But women on the low-fat diet were less likely to develop certain hard-to-treat tumors.  One limitation of the study is that researchers relied on women to accurately describe their eating habits in questionnaires, the researchers note in JAMA Oncology. Another drawback is that women in the diet group managed only minimal increases in their consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains.  Because women in the low-fat diet group did lose weight relative to other participants, it’s also possible that weight rather than the fat content of the diet might explain the differences in cancer survival odds, said Dr. Graham Colditz, a researcher at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “For lowering breast cancer risk - and cancer risk overall - the most important part of diet is to keep calories in check,” Colditz said by email. “Weight gain and obesity is an important risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer - and 12 other cancers.”  Not all fat is created equal, either. “There is no evidence that total fat intake affects the risk of breast cancer,” Colditz said. “There is growing evidence, however, suggesting that type of fat could be important, with diets rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats possibly lowering risk, and those higher in saturated and animal fats possibly increasing risk.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2LYypwv JAMA Oncology, online May 24, 2018.

The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, studied how to treat women with early-stage breast cancer that responds to hormone therapy. Women were deemed to have a medium level risk of the cancer coming back based on a 21-gene panel known as Oncotype DX from Genomic Health (GHDX.O). The test predicts the likelihood of cancer recurrence within 10 years. Those who score low on the test - from zero to 10 - are already told to skip chemotherapy after their tumors are removed and they receive hormone therapy. Those who score high - 26 to 100 - receive both hormone therapy and chemotherapy. The study, dubbed TAILORx, was also published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It involved more than 10,000 women with breast cancer that had not spread to nearby lymph nodes and whose tumors respond to hormone therapy and test negative for the HER2 gene. Of those, 6,711 scored in the intermediate range of 11-25, and were randomly assigned hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy plus chemotherapy. Slideshow (2 Images)The study found that all women over 50 with this type of breast cancer could skip chemotherapy, a group that represented 85 percent of the study’s population. In addition, women 50 and younger who scored between zero and 15 could be spared chemotherapy and its toxic side effects.  However, chemotherapy did offer some benefit to women aged 50 and younger who had a cancer recurrence score of 16-25, researchers found. Dr. Steven Shak, chief scientific officer at Genomic Health,   said about four in 10 women in the United States with early stage breast cancers are not tested for recurrence risk. He expects the study’s results will change that practice. “This is going to provide the highest level of evidence now for our test being indispensable in clinical practice,” Shak said.  The company currently provides tests to more than 900,000 patients in more than 90 countries, Shak said. In the United States, the test costs $4,000 and is covered by Medicare and all major private insurers.

The state‚s new automatic voter registration law ranks among the most sweeping in the country, while its funding of Planned Parenthood, package of gun control laws, renewable energy legislation and a measure to provide state financial aid to immigrants who came to the United States as children are all part of the progressive playbook.In a state whose political profile has been marked by scandal and dominated most recently by a bellicose Republican governor, the first few months of Gov. Philip D. Murphy‚s Democratic tenure have seen an abrupt ideological makeover as New Jersey lurches to the left, joining the ranks of the most liberal states in the nation.His aggressive steering reflects the mandate Mr. Murphy believes he was given last year by his lopsided victory.But his policies have also left Republicans and even moderate Democrats with a case of whiplash and raised serious questions about how Mr. Murphy will pay for his agenda in a state saddled with severe financial difficulties. New Jersey owes its state-run pension system $119 billion, according to Standard & Poor‚s Global Ratings, one of the largest debt obligations in the country, which has contributed to 11 credit downgrades in the past decade. The state also has the nation‚s highest property taxes, with many residents facing higher bills under the recent federal tax overhaul, while it has consistently underfunded local school districts. At the same time, Mr. Murphy‚s $37.4 billion budget comes with $2.7 billion in new spending, including proposals to make community colleges tuition-free for many families, to expand prekindergarten and to significantly increase funding for the state‚s beleaguered public transit system. But to pay for all this, Mr. Murphy is counting on initiatives that so far have been coolly received by some leaders in the Democratic-controlled Legislature ‚ notably $1.7 billion in new taxes, including a levy on the wealthy, and the legalization of recreational marijuana, which would also add to the state‚s coffers.Mr. Murphy defended his blueprint, saying it was motivated not by politics but by a desire to make New Jersey a fairer state. ‚You can‚t make economic progress without social progress, and social progress can‚t be achieved without economic progress,‚ he said in an interview, adding, ‚I don‚t wake up every day to be liberal for the sake of being liberal.‚But Mr. Murphy‚s approach has provoked fierce backlash from many Republicans.‚He‚s not liberal; he‚s extreme,‚ said Jon Bramnick, the Republican minority leader in the State Assembly. ‚I don‚t even have a problem with people who are somewhat liberal, though I may disagree with them. But this is not a liberal agenda. This is an extreme left-wing agenda that is sending people out of the state who might have stayed.‚ The state‚s shifting political winds extend beyond Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive who campaigned on a raft of progressive promises. Four of the state‚s five Republican-held congressional seats are considered competitive in this year‚s midterm elections. The State Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of a stricter separation of church and state. And the mayor of Hoboken, Ravinder S. Bhalla, the first Sikh to be elected mayor in New Jersey, issued an ordinance that public and private single-occupancy restrooms be gender-neutral. Gurbir Grewal, who achieved a milestone as the first Sikh in the country to become a state attorney general, has joined numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, including challenges to the travel ban and to a prohibition on transgender people in the military.Taken together, the state is undergoing a rapid transition from eight years of Gov.

Having grown up in the 1960s, Mr. Murphy said that the era of his childhood, when ‚the government put a lot of wind in your sails,‚ helped cement his view that raising taxes and investing more in government was the best use of people‚s money. As an example, his office estimates that raising the sales tax to 7 percent from 6.625 percent will cost a family with annual income between $70,000 and $120,000 an additional $85 per year, a relatively small amount that Mr. Murphy says can be used to improve people‚s lives.‚I‚m not making light for those $85, or any one of those $85, but I will say this: I do believe with all my heart that if we get towards fully funding public education, pre-K, community college, triple our investment in New Jersey Transit,‚ he said, ‚that‚s money really well spent and that family will benefit multiples of that $85.‚Still, the budget negotiations are likely to be contentious, and Mr. Murphy may well have to make compromises that could anger his base or run counter to campaign promises.‚Phil‚s got a lot of good will,‚ said Howard Dean, the former presidential candidate and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who recruited Mr. Murphy to be the finance chairman for the party. ‚That‚s a big deal because he‚s going to need all the political capital he can get.‚Mr. Murphy‚s team believes that his victory margin of more than 14 percentage points gives him potent political leverage.The governor also plans on using the momentum that his early tenure has generated to help the party in the midterms by raising money for candidates or by energizing voters. He hosted one of the first fund-raisers to support the re-election of Senator Robert Menendez, seeking to ensure that no credible threat to Mr. Menendez‚s seat emerges despite the ethical cloud hanging over the senator‚s head.

REUTERS/Tom Mihalek/File PhotoThe legislation now goes to Governor Phil Murphy, who would have to sign it before operators could start taking sports wagers. He is not expected to sign it this week, according to his office. The bill contains none of the fraud-fighting measures requested by professional sports leagues, including real-time game data sharing with casinos and state regulators, as well as fees to the leagues to help pay for expanded monitoring and investigations. New Jersey and other states are racing for a piece of the estimated $150 billion spent on illegal annual wagers in the United States, after the top court in May overturned a 1992 law that had banned sports wagering except in a few places, including Las Vegas. More Americans now than ever, 69 percent, say gambling is morally acceptable, according to a Gallup poll released on Thursday. Delaware, which already had limited sports wagers, rolled out full-scale betting on Tuesday. In New Jersey, the U.S. unit of UK-based William Hill PLC has for years been preparing sports books at Monmouth Park Racetrack. In the state’s fiscally stressed gambling hub Atlantic City, William Hill also plans to operate a 7,500-square-foot, $6 million sports betting area at the twice-bankrupt former Revel Casino Hotel, which is now called the Ocean Resort Casino and is set to open later in June. London-listed gambling companies, facing tighter regulations and higher taxes in their home markets, are likely to seek expansion across the Atlantic, especially as sports betting is set to grow in the United States. The Dublin-based bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair agreed in May, after the U.S. high-court’s ruling, to merge its U.S. business with fantasy sports giant FanDuel. New Jersey itself is expected to pull in between $12 million and $17 million in the first full year of operation, according to legislative estimates.  That would be a tiny drop in the bucket for New Jersey’s proposed $37.4 billion budget for fiscal 2019, which is still being finalized. The projection is based on an assumption that 28 percent of the state’s population will bet on sports and on the 8.5 percent tax rate on gross revenues from in-person wagering. The state can also impose a 13 percent tax on internet sports bets, which could begin 30 days after the law goes into effect.

The state‚s new automatic voter registration law ranks among the most sweeping in the country, while its funding of Planned Parenthood, package of gun control laws, renewable energy legislation and a measure to provide state financial aid to immigrants who came to the United States as children are all part of the progressive playbook.In a state whose political profile has been marked by scandal and dominated most recently by a bellicose Republican governor, the first few months of Gov. Philip D. Murphy‚s Democratic tenure have seen an abrupt ideological makeover as New Jersey lurches to the left, joining the ranks of the most liberal states in the nation.His aggressive steering reflects the mandate Mr. Murphy believes he was given last year by his lopsided victory.But his policies have also left Republicans and even moderate Democrats with a case of whiplash and raised serious questions about how Mr. Murphy will pay for his agenda in a state saddled with severe financial difficulties. New Jersey owes its state-run pension system $119 billion, according to Standard & Poor‚s Global Ratings, one of the largest debt obligations in the country, which has contributed to 11 credit downgrades in the past decade. The state also has the nation‚s highest property taxes, with many residents facing higher bills under the recent federal tax overhaul, while it has consistently underfunded local school districts. At the same time, Mr. Murphy‚s $37.4 billion budget comes with $2.7 billion in new spending, including proposals to make community colleges tuition-free for many families, to expand prekindergarten and to significantly increase funding for the state‚s beleaguered public transit system. But to pay for all this, Mr. Murphy is counting on initiatives that so far have been coolly received by some leaders in the Democratic-controlled Legislature ‚ notably $1.7 billion in new taxes, including a levy on the wealthy, and the legalization of recreational marijuana, which would also add to the state‚s coffers.Mr. Murphy defended his blueprint, saying it was motivated not by politics but by a desire to make New Jersey a fairer state. ‚You can‚t make economic progress without social progress, and social progress can‚t be achieved without economic progress,‚ he said in an interview, adding, ‚I don‚t wake up every day to be liberal for the sake of being liberal.‚But Mr. Murphy‚s approach has provoked fierce backlash from many Republicans.‚He‚s not liberal; he‚s extreme,‚ said Jon Bramnick, the Republican minority leader in the State Assembly. ‚I don‚t even have a problem with people who are somewhat liberal, though I may disagree with them. But this is not a liberal agenda. This is an extreme left-wing agenda that is sending people out of the state who might have stayed.‚ The state‚s shifting political winds extend beyond Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive who campaigned on a raft of progressive promises. Four of the state‚s five Republican-held congressional seats are considered competitive in this year‚s midterm elections. The State Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of a stricter separation of church and state. And the mayor of Hoboken, Ravinder S. Bhalla, the first Sikh to be elected mayor in New Jersey, issued an ordinance that public and private single-occupancy restrooms be gender-neutral. Gurbir Grewal, who achieved a milestone as the first Sikh in the country to become a state attorney general, has joined numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, including challenges to the travel ban and to a prohibition on transgender people in the military.Taken together, the state is undergoing a rapid transition from eight years of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and a friend of President Trump who clashed often with the Legislature. It is becoming, much like California and New York, a liberal bulwark against the White House.As the Trump administration and congressional Republicans sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then cut the budget for advertising enrollment periods, Mr. Murphy signed an executive order to promote enrollment in New Jersey.After Mr. Trump signed an executive order to open nearly all coastal waters to offshore drilling, Mr. Murphy signed a law banning offshore drilling in New Jersey.And as federal officials have intensified immigration arrests, Mr. Murphy has sought to protect the state‚s immigrant population, signing the bill to provide in-state tuition and financial aid to undocumented immigrants.

Tillerson warned on Wednesday that American democracy was threatened by a growing ‚crisis of ethics and integrity.‚‚If our leaders seek to conceal the truth, or we as people become accepting of alternative realities that are no longer grounded in facts, then we as American citizens are on a pathway to relinquishing our freedom,‚ he said in a commencement address at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Va.Even small falsehoods and exaggerations are problematic, Mr. Tillerson said. He did not mention Mr. Trump by name, although the president is  prone to both.‚When we as people, a free people, go wobbly on the truth even on what may seem the most trivial matters, we go wobbly on America,‚ he said. Mr. Tillerson arrived in Washington after running Exxon Mobil, one of the world‚s largest corporations, backed by business leaders and some foreign policy experts as a man who could bring experience and ballast to an untested administration.But as the nation‚s top diplomat, he soon found himself at odds with the president over a variety of issues, including negotiating with North Korea and extending the Iran nuclear deal, and privately humiliated until he was fired by a tweet.Since then, he has largely been in seclusion at his Texas ranch. He had agreed to deliver the V.M.I. commencement address before he was fired.In his address, he cut to the heart of the most significant criticisms of the president, that Mr. Trump exaggerates and constructs his own truths and that he has undermined ethical standards in Washington.‚If we do not as Americans confront the crisis of ethics and integrity in our society and among our leaders in both the public and private sector ‚ and regrettably at times even the nonprofit sector ‚ then American democracy as we know it is entering its twilight years,‚ Mr. Tillerson warned. Mr. Tillerson‚s 14-month tenure at the State Department was marked by conflict with Mr. Trump and an exodus of some of the nation‚s most experienced diplomats. In the months before his own departure, Mr. Tillerson admitted he had only belatedly learned to enjoy the job ‚ perhaps unsurprising, given that he was at one point notably rebuffed by presidential tweet on North Korea and, at another, forced to deny that he had called Mr. Trump a ‚moron.‚He and Mr. Trump disagreed on an array of specific issues, from the Paris climate accord to free trade. He seemed to reference some of those disputes in his speech on Wednesday, reminding his audience that the United States gets much of its strength from a network of alliances.‚One of America‚s great advantages is we have many allies,‚ he said. ‚Our adversaries ‚ China, Russia, Iran and the terrorist organizations ‚ have few.‚Relations with Europe are at their lowest point in years, bedeviled by a series of disagreements with the Trump administration over the climate accord, the Iran deal and trade disputes. Mr. Tillerson suggested this was problematic.‚We must never take these long-held allies for granted,‚ he said. ‚We must motivate and strengthen them ‚ not just in our areas of complete agreement, but particularly in bridging our differences both in trading relations and in national security matters.‚Mr. Tillerson made a full-throated appeal for the benefits of free trade, warning of the ‚anxiety and fear about growth in foreign markets and about the global movement of jobs.‚ He said that ‚every nation has a right to aspire to a better quality of life, and that free trade and economic growth are the means by which opportunity is created for all people.‚ It was a notable defense of free trade and developing nations from a veteran of an administration that has threatened to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement and impose billions of dollars in tariffs on rivals and allies alike, and uses ‚America First‚ as its guiding principle.Mr. Tillerson also said citizens must demand that America‚s future be ‚fact-based, not based on wishful thinking, not hoped-for outcomes made in shallow promises, but with a cleareyed view of the facts as they are and guided by the truth that will set us free to seek solutions to our most daunting challenges.‚In Washington, just moments before Mr. Tillerson began speaking, his successor, Mike Pompeo, was holding his first meeting with the entire staff of the State Department. In his own prepared remarks, Mr. Pompeo made clear that he intended to make a sharp break from Mr. Tillerson‚s tenure.‚It would be silly today to lay out for you my ‚grand strategy‚ for the State Department. I have too much to learn,‚ Mr. Pompeo said in a dose of humility many diplomats later said was welcome. ‚Nor will I tick off country-by-country threats. You know all that.‚It was a reference to Mr. Tillerson‚s own first all-hands meeting at the department, which had amounted to a wide-ranging lecture on world affairs. Mr. Pompeo did not mention Mr. Tillerson by name but said he would not try to school a building full of professional diplomats.Mr. Pompeo promised to bring the State Department‚s ‚swagger back,‚ which he said on Wednesday was an ‚aggressiveness born of the righteous knowledge that our cause is just, special and built upon America‚s core principles.‚‚We should carry that diplomatic swagger to the ends of the Earth, humbly, nobly and with the skill and courage I know you all possess,‚ he said. Back at the V.M.I. campus, Mr. Tillerson told the graduating cadets that as they entered the world, they must ‚carefully consider the values and the culture of the organizations in which you seek to work.‚‚Look for employers who set high standards for ethical conduct,‚ he said.","In Rebuke of Trump, Tillerson Says Lies Are a Threat to Democracy","May 17, 2018 /  12:59 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tillerson/tillerson-warns-of-u-s-ethical-crisis-in-apparent-swipe-at-trump-idUSKCN1II04B,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In an apparent swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday decried what he called “a growing crisis in ethics and integrity” in American public life. “If our leaders seek to conceal the truth or we as people become accepting of alternative realities that are no longer grounded in facts, then we as American citizens are on a pathway to relinquishing our freedom,” Tillerson said in a graduation address at the Virginia Military Institute. Tillerson, who was fired by Trump in March after little more than a year on the job, did not mention the U.S. president by name during his address to cadets at the school in Lexington, Virginia. But he warned that a crisis involving truthfulness and integrity is threatening U.S. democracy. “When we as people, a free people, go wobbly on the truth, even on what may seem the most trivial of matters, we go wobbly on America,” Tillerson said. “If we do not as Americans confront the crisis of ethics and integrity in our society, and among our leaders in both public and private sector - and regrettably at times even the nonprofit sector - then American democracy as we know it is entering its twilight years,” he said. Tillerson’s speech was among his first public remarks since Trump dismissed him, ending a rocky tenure overseeing the State Department and policy disputes with the White House. The U.S. president has frequently said or tweeted statements not backed up by fact. For example, he insisted, despite evidence to the contrary, that the crowd at his January 2017  inauguration was bigger than at predecessor Barack Obama’s. More recently, Trump at first disputed that he was aware of a $130,000 payment made by his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleges an affair with Trump. But another Trump attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, then said Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payment. In an ethics disclosure on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged repaying Cohen more than $100,000 for an undisclosed purpose. In his speech, Tillerson said a commitment to facts cements U.S. alliances with other democracies worldwide.     “It is also that foundational commitment to truth and facts that binds us to other like-minded democratic nations - that we Americans will always deal with them from the same set of truths and facts,” he said. “And it is truth that says to our adversaries, we say what we mean, and we mean what we say.” Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson waves to applauding workers after delivering his parting remarks at the State Department in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2018.

They then got out of the car and attacked the police guards using long swords,‚ he said.An Indonesian news reporter who happened to be on the scene was also hurt.A fifth person in the attackers‚ car drove off, hitting the police officer who later died, before eventually being captured by pursuing officers. The attack in Sumatra followed a string of bombings halfway across the sprawling country, in East Java Province, where a family of six suicide bombers including children attacked three churches in the provincial capital, Surabaya, on Sunday, killing 12 people and themselves.On Sunday night, a woman and one of her children were killed in a bomb explosion inside their home in a suburb of Surabaya as the police moved in to make arrests. The father was shot dead by the police.On Monday, a family of five riding on two motorcycles, who the police say were part of the same terrorist group, detonated an explosive at the entrance of Surabaya Police Headquarters, injuring several officers who were standing guard. The only survivor among the family was an 8-year-old girl, who was taken to a hospital.Investigators believe the families in the attacks on Sunday and Monday were all part of the same cell of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, an Indonesian terrorist group that has declared loyalty to the Islamic State.The police on Wednesday said they were not yet sure whether the attackers at the police headquarters in Sumatra were also linked to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah or to the Islamic State. Later Wednesday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement carried by its media outlet, Amaq. The Islamic State has also claimed responsibility for the Surabaya attacks, and for a riot that took place in a police detention center outside Jakarta several days before the bombings began. Terrorism suspects and convicts being held there, most of whom were linked to the Islamic State, staged a two-day uprising, seizing weapons and hostages and killing five guards before eventually surrendering. One inmate also died after being shot by guards.The Indonesian police said they were continuing to arrest members of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah. Tito Karnavian, the national police chief, said on Wednesday that counterterrorism forces had detained the head of the group‚s East Java wing. The suspect, named Samsul Arif, was arrested with his wife in the East Java town of Singosari.In West Java, in the city of Tangerang just outside of Jakarta, the police raided three sites and arrested four people who they said had been training recruits in terror tactics for Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, according to Indonesian news reports. The reports said the police had confiscated an Islamic State flag and a handbook on terrorist operations.The United States Embassy issued a nationwide security alert on Wednesday, advising Americans to review their security plans, avoid crowds and demonstrations and keep a low profile.‚Police continue to conduct aggressive operations against terrorists, including in the days leading up to and including Ramadan,‚ the alert said. Indonesia, the world‚s most populous Muslim-majority nation, begins observing the holy month of Ramadan on Thursday.Indonesia has suffered numerous attacks by domestic terrorists since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, including bombings on the resort island of Bali in 2002 and 2005, hotel bombings in Jakarta in 2003 and 2009, and an attack on a police post in central Jakarta in 2016.The attackers were either linked to Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, the authorities said.In recent years, the police and Indonesia‚s minority Christian population have been prime targets for terrorists here. Indonesia‚s counterterrorism police force, known as Detachment 88, has been fully deployed in the wake of the recent attacks.On Tuesday evening, the police raided a densely populated neighborhood in Surabaya, Indonesia‚s second-largest city, while searching for the brother of Anton Ferdiantono, the suspected militant who officials say accidentally detonated an explosive device in his apartment on Sunday night, killing his wife and one of their children. Three other children survived.During the police operation, there was about an hour of gunfire and other activity related to the raid in the working-class neighborhood. Surabaya‚s mayor, Tri Rismaharini, who came to the scene, said that counterterrorism police had shot dead Dedi Sulistiantono, the younger brother of Mr. Ferdiantono.Earlier, a police spokesman in East Java, Frans Barung Mangera, said that the suspect had fought back, which was why Detachment 88 ‚had to take firm action.‚ Ms. Rismaharini said that Mr. Sulistiantono‚s wife and four children had been taken into custody.In the family‚s Surabaya neighborhood, a warren of rented rooms and small eateries, neighbors described Mr. Sulistiantono as religious and reserved. He did not, for instance, attend the mosque just down the street from the rented room where he lived with his family, they said.‚We never interacted with him,‚ said Hengki Firmansyah, a neighborhood administrative official. ‚He never spoke with us. He has his own congregation that we were not part of.‚Mr. Sulistiantono‚s wife, however, did not wear the niqab, a conservative Muslim veil that covers all of the head and face save for the eyes. She instead wore a hijab, a face-baring veil that is common in Indonesia. Their children did not attend public school, and their youngest child, the boy, only went to evening Quran classes. At around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, the police pushed back a crowd that had gathered at the alley where Mr. Sulistiantono lived, because they said they would be ‚detonating a bomb found inside the house.‚Minutes later, an explosion resounded.",Indonesia Sword Attack on Police Follows String of Deadly Bombings,"May 16, 2018 /  3:16 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-security/indonesia-police-shoot-dead-four-men-after-attack-on-riau-hq-idUSKCN1IH094,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian police shot dead four men on Wednesday after they  used samurai swords to attack officers at Riau police headquarters in Pekanbaru, Sumatra, a police spokesman said.

Two officers were wounded in the attack, while another was killed after one of the perpetrators tried to escape and crashed into the officer, he said.  “The one who escaped has been captured and secured at Pekanbaru police station,” Wasisto said. The spokesman said that a journalist who had been at the police station was also hurt after being hit by the car. Earlier, an internal police report said that one of the dead men had a suspected bomb strapped to his body. Wasisto did not comment on this.

But the attack comes after a series of suicide bombings by Islamist militants targeting churches and a police building in Indonesia’s second-biggest of city of Surabaya over the past few days. The suicide bombings, involving families with young children, and an explosion at an apartment where militants were suspected to have been constructing bombs have left around 30 people dead, including 13 suspected perpetrators, police said.   The attacks are the worst in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country since the bombing of tourist-packed restaurants in Bali in 2005. Police suspect they were carried out by a cell of the Islamic State-inspired group Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an umbrella organization on a U.S. State Department terrorist list that is reckoned to have drawn hundreds of Indonesian sympathizers of Islamic State.

1721126,145,['2018-05-16t08:36:43.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/world/asia/taliban-farah-afghanistan.html,"KABUL, Afghanistan ‚ Taliban insurgents abandoned their effort to take over the capital of the western Afghan province of Farah, leaving the city early Wednesday without apparent opposition, local residents said.Even with 25 members of the security forces and five civilians killed, officials immediately hailed the insurgents‚ departure as a victory. They said that hundreds of insurgents had been killed in the one-day assault on Farah city and that the government‚s response proved it could beat back any Taliban initiative to take and hold territory.But for many Afghans, especially residents in battered Farah, the assault showed mostly that the insurgents could attack at will even against a well-entrenched government position backed up by both Afghan and American air power.‚The Taliban managed to leave the city without a single shot being fired, and the night was calm,‚ said Abdullah Khan, a resident reached by telephone. ‚It shows the utmost incompetence of our forces. The Taliban were wandering the Farah city streets openly without fear as if they had lived there a long time, making jokes with their friends and telling citizens to stay calm and not worry.‚ A team of American Army Special Forces commandos, accompanied by armed drones and A-10 ground attack jets, was dispatched to Farah to help Afghan forces push back the Taliban, according to United States military officials.The decision to send the Green Beret soldiers into an area that is usually overseen by the Italian military echoes a similar tactic in October 2015 after the Taliban took control of the city of Kunduz. Then, the team of roughly 12 soldiers fought alongside their Afghan counterparts and helped call in airstrikes. The Green Berets were later found partly responsible for the Oct. 3, 2015, bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital, which killed at least 30 people.Farah has come under repeated attack from the Taliban in recent years, and it nearly fell to a determined assault in October 2016. Local officials have placed blame on support for the insurgents from Iran, which borders Farah Province.‚Overrunning parts of Farah city was a big achievement for the Taliban,‚ said Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired Afghan Army general and military analyst in Kabul. ‚They showed their power to the whole world.‚That success would not have come, however, without support from Iran, Mr. Amarkhel said. ‚The main reason for the collapse of parts of Farah is Iran,‚ he said. Najib Danish, the spokesman for the Interior Ministry, declared the fighting over Wednesday, saying: ‚The whole Farah city is cleared from the Taliban. Around 300 members of the Taliban were killed in the fighting. House-to-house searching for the Taliban and clearance operation is underway.‚The governor of Farah Province, Basir Salangi, vowed revenge for the assault. ‚Security forces will follow the enemy in the districts as well, and military operations will continue until the Taliban are defeated in the province,‚ he said. ‚The Taliban will pay the price for attacking Farah.‚But across the country, the insurgents were claiming more territory on Wednesday. The Taliban said that two more areas had fallen to their fighters: Jaghatu district in Ghazni Province in the country‚s southeast, and Dara-e Bom in Badghis Province in the northwest, according to a WhatsApp statement from the Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid.In Badghis Province, Faiz Mohammad, the deputy governor, denied the Taliban assertion on Dara-e Bom. ‚This area is in government control, and the claims in this regard are untrue,‚ he said. Officials in Ghazni Province could not immediately be reached.But Mirza Ali, the departing governor of Qades district, which includes Dara-e Bom, confirmed that government forces abandoned their defense of Dara-e Bom against the Taliban late Tuesday night.He said that there had been 360 soldiers and police guarding the strategic area but that all had fled without offering resistance, allowing the insurgents to take control.A provincial council member in Farah, Dadullah Qani, said that the insurgents left the city after Afghan security forces began searching for them house by house, and that they had left behind booby-trapped bombs. Mr. Khan, the Farah resident, said that the insurgents mostly left homes and businesses alone, but that they did burn several cafes that served alcohol, leaving notes warning their owners against doing so.On a Facebook account that is often used to post material from the Taliban, a video apparently showed insurgents on Tuesday entering the Police Headquarters in Farah City and leading a handcuffed officer outside, before debating whether to shoot him.The fighting in Farah was part of a recent increase in the tempo of attacks by the insurgents, since their announcement of a spring offensive late in April and their explicit rejection of Afghan government peace initiatives.The insurgents now control about 14 of Afghanistan‚s 407 districts, not counting their advances claimed on Wednesday, with 46 other districts under the group‚s influence, according to figures from a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a United States government agency. A third of the population lives in areas controlled, influenced or contested by the Taliban, the report said.Two districts fell to the insurgents last week, with one of them, Tala Wa Barfak, still in Taliban hands and blocking a strategic highway in Baghlan Province in northern Afghanistan. About 200 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed in fighting in the past week, according to official accounts.","Taliban Overrun Afghan City, Kill 30 People and Leave","May 15, 2018 /  5:52 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-taliban/taliban-battle-into-west-afghan-city-in-new-crisis-for-government-idUSKCN1IG0KY,"HERAT, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Taliban fighters with heavy weapons and night-vision equipment fought their way close to the center of the western city of Farah on Tuesday, as Afghan forces with U.S. air support battled to force them back, officials and residents said. Residents look at an Army vehicle which was damaged during battle between Afghan security forces and Taliban in Farah province, Afghanistan May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer  NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVE.Residents of the city, capital of Farah province on the border with Iran, have warned for months the city was vulnerable and the attack threatened a repeat of the Taliban’s capture of the northern city of Kunduz in 2015. Local people said Taliban forces began their attack at around 2.00 a.m. (2130 GMT Monday) from several directions and a senior official said the situation was serious early in the day as the insurgents overran several areas and the provincial governor left the city. However, as special forces units, backed by both Afghan and U.S. air strikes rushed to counter the assault, the situation stabilized later in the day. Mohammad Radmanish, a spokesman for the defense ministry in Kabul, said the insurgents had been pushed out of the city and reinforcements, including special forces units from neighboring provinces, had been ordered to Farah. The NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Kabul said U.S. A-10 attack aircraft were also supporting Afghan forces and there had been at least one drone strike, while Afghan air force A-29s and Mi-17 helicopters had conducted multiple attacks. “Farah city remains under government control, and the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, supported by U.S. Forces-Afghanistan airpower, are on the offensive against the Taliban,” spokesman Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell said.   However the speed of the attack, which saw large parts of the city including police headquarters and the governor’s compound under siege at different times, caused shock among residents. “The Taliban are moving very fast, if the government does not take serious and speedy action, the province is going to collapse to Taliban,” said Hamidullah, a resident of the city reached by telephone in the morning. The attack adds to the problems facing President Ashraf Ghani’s government, which has come under increasing public pressure over worsening security ahead of parliamentary elections due in October. There were no detailed casualty assessments but a Resolute Support spokesman said dozens of Taliban fighters had been killed and there had also been an unspecified number of casualties on the government side. In one incident, at least 18 soldiers were killed by a suicide bomber in the Askarabad area of the city, Farid Bakhtawar, head of a provincial council said. However, Radmanish said only two soldiers were killed in the blast.

NO ARCHIVESNEW U.S. STRATEGY Farah province, a remote and sparsely populated area, has seen months of heavy fighting, with hundreds of police and soldiers killed and severe losses inflicted even on elite special forces units. Residents have warned repeatedly that the provincial capital was under threat. “Farah is in dire need of air support,” Dadullah Qane, a provincial council member, said by telephone as the fighting went on in the morning. “The Taliban are well equipped with heavy arms and night vision equipment.” Tuesday’s assault adds to the growing number of crisis points around Afghanistan since the Taliban began their annual spring offensive last month, including a series of deadly suicide attacks in the capital, Kabul. District centers have been lost or threatened in the northern provinces of Baghlan and Badakhshan and there has been heavy fighting in Faryab in the northwest and Ghazni and Zabul, south of Kabul. Although the insurgents have been unable to take and hold any provincial center, they are active across Afghanistan and the government has firm control over no more than 56 percent of the country, according to U.S. estimates. The United States has boosted its assistance to the government under a new strategy announced by President Donald Trump last year, sending thousands of additional troops and advisers and stepping up air strikes to support Afghan forces. Farah, which also borders the opium-rich Taliban heartland of Helmand province, has key smuggling routes into Iran. Hundreds of fighters have moved there as U.S. and Afghan forces have stepped up operations in Helmand. As the fighting raged on Tuesday, Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi warned civilians to remain in their houses. “Mujahideen have nothing to do with civilians, only military positions are the target,” he said in a statement, referring to Taliban fighters. Residents said shops, schools and government offices were closed and the Taliban had set up posts around the city and were checking identity cards and preventing people from fleeing.

But the judge, Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court, said that although Mr. Atilla had ‚unquestionably furthered‚ the scheme, he was ‚somewhat of a cog in the wheel‚ and not ‚a mastermind.‚‚Mr. Atilla,‚ Judge Berman said, ‚was a reluctant participant and one who was following orders, albeit improper orders in my judgment.‚Mr. Atilla‚s lawyers, seeking leniency for their client, argued that his role had been relatively minor, especially compared with that of Reza Zarrab, a well-connected Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was indicted along with Mr. Atilla and seven other Turkish and Iranian defendants. Mr. Zarrab, 34, pleaded guilty and cooperated with the authorities.The government had alleged in court papers that Mr. Atilla, Mr. Zarrab and the others had used Halkbank to ‚launder billions of dollars-worth of Iranian oil proceeds, ultimately creating a slush fund for Iran to use however it wished ‚ the very harm that U.S. sanctions were put in place to avoid.‚In court on Wednesday, a prosecutor, Michael D. Lockard, disputed descriptions of Mr. Atilla as a minor or reluctant player in the conspiracy, which he called ‚the biggest sanctions evasion case prosecuted in the United States that we are aware of.‚ ‚When the rubber hit the road,‚ Mr. Lockard said, ‚Mr. Atilla chose lies and deceptions, not honesty and integrity.‚ ‚This is not a case about drugs,‚ Mr. Lockard said. ‚It‚s not a case about shipments of weapons. But it is, in a very real sense, a case about nuclear capability. Nuclear capability by the world‚s foremost state sponsor of terrorism.""Judge Berman did not contest the gravity of the sanctions evasion plot. And he noted that Mr. Zarrab had given ‚credible‚ and ‚largely unrefuted‚ testimony at Mr. Atilla‚s trial about how the conspirators had been able to ‚transfer or free up millions upon millions of dollars of Iranian proceeds, primarily from the sale of Iranian oil,‚ in violation of the sanctions.But Judge Berman indicated that Mr. Atilla‚s role did not warrant the longer sentence the government was seeking. The judge also noted that Halkbank had not been charged in the case.Mr. Atilla will be credited with the time he has spent in jail since his March 2017 arrest.One of Mr. Atilla‚s lawyers, Victor J. Rocco, called the sentence fair but said his client would appeal the conviction. ‚Our objective is to get him home as quick as possible,‚ Mr. Rocco said.At Mr. Atilla‚s trial late last year, Mr. Zarrab testified that he had paid millions of dollars in bribes to Zafer Caglayan, then Turkey‚s economy minister, and Suleyman Aslan, the general manager of Halkbank, to facilitate the scheme. (Mr. Caglayan and Mr. Aslan were among the seven other defendants charged in the case, who all remain at large.) Mr. Zarrab also suggested in his testimony that Recep Tayyip Erdogan, when he was Turkey‚s prime minister in 2012, approved the operation. Mr. Erdogan, now Turkey‚s president, and other Turkish officials have repeatedly denounced the American government‚s prosecution of the sanctions case. The Turkish Foreign Ministry, in a statement on Wednesday, sharply criticized the sentence, saying it had come ‚after an entirely feigned process which is inconsistent with the principle of fair trial.‚The statement accused the court of relying on ‚forged evidence and false statements,‚ which it said had been fabricated by followers of an Islamic cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Mr. Erdogan accuses Mr. Gulen, his former ally, of fomenting a failed coup in 2016.In an interview with Bloomberg.com this week, Mr. Erdogan said that Mr. Atilla was innocent of any crime and that Halkbank had also been done ‚a great injustice.‚‚If Hakan Atilla is going to be declared a criminal, that would be almost equivalent to declaring the Turkish Republic a criminal,‚ Mr. Erdogan said.Alluding to the intense interest in Turkey about the case, Judge Berman took the unusual step of having a copy of the official transcript of the sentencing posted on the court‚s website.‚The idea is so that everyone will know exactly what was said here,‚ he explained in court, ‚and so that everybody can evaluate the outcome for themselves.‚",Turkish Banker in Iran Sanctions-Busting Case Sentenced to 32 Months,"May 16, 2018 /  5:26 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-turkey-zarrab/update-4-turkish-banker-gets-32-months-prison-in-u-s-case-over-iran-sanctions-idUSL2N1SN1EQ,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge sentenced Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a banker at Turkey’s state-controlled Halkbank (HALKB.IS), to 32 months in prison on Wednesday after he was convicted earlier this year of taking part in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Atilla, a 47-year-old Turkish citizen, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan. The case has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has condemned it as a political attack on his government.  Prosecutors said the central figure in the sanctions-dodging scheme was wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who  pleaded guilty to fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges, and testified for several days as the U.S. government’s star witness against Atilla. Victor Rocco, one of Atilla’s lawyers, said his client would appeal his conviction, but called the sentence “fair.” Atilla, who worked as a deputy general manager at Halkbank, has already spent 14 months in jail. That time will count toward his sentence, and he could be freed early for good behavior. There was no immediate response to the sentencing from the Turkish government or Halkbank. The bank has previously said that all of its transactions have been lawful. Related CoverageTurkey says U.S. ruling on Turkish banker illegitimate, not credibleProsecutors had sought a sentence of about 20 years for Atilla, who worked as a deputy general manager at Halkbank.  However, Berman said before imposing his sentence that the evidence at trial showed Atilla was a minor player in the sanctions-dodging scheme, and “at times a reluctant one at that,” largely following orders from his supervisor. Berman also said Atilla “appears to have led an exemplary life in Turkey,” pointing to more than a hundred letters he received from Atilla’s family and friends in his support. Rocco agreed that leniency was justified. “What we need to show the world in proceedings such as this, especially today, especially now, is that we Americans aren’t bullies,” he said. Cathy Fleming, another of Atilla’s lawyers, read a brief statement by Atilla, translated from Turkish, asking for Berman’s “understanding of the situation that I and my family are in.” “Apart from my family, I have no other priorities,” the statement said. Atilla was found guilty on Jan. 3 of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions law. His conviction followed a four-week trial in which Atilla testified in his own defense. Prosecutors have said that beginning around 2012, Atilla was involved in a scheme to help Iran spend oil and gas revenues abroad using fraudulent gold and food transactions through Halkbank, violating U.S. sanctions. Zarrab, who has yet to be sentenced, testified during Atilla’s trial that he bribed Turkish officials, and that Erdogan personally signed off on parts of the scheme while serving as Turkey’s prime minister. Erdogan has said the U.S. case was based on evidence fabricated by followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom he has also blamed for a failed 2016 coup attempt. The Turkish president has repeatedly condemned Atilla’s conviction, most recently in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. “If Hakan Atilla is going to be declared a criminal, that would be almost equivalent to declaring the Turkish Republic a criminal,” Erdogan said.

Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that Mrs. Trump, 48, underwent an embolization procedure to treat the kidney condition.”The procedure was successful and there were no complications,” Grisham said. “The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere.” President Trump spoke with his wife of 13 years before the procedure and talked to the doctor after it was completed, a White House official said. Trump later traveled by his Marine One helicopter to Walter Reed to visit his wife. “Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!” he tweeted. An embolization is a minimally invasive procedure often used to block the flow of blood to a tumor or an abnormal area of tissue. Dr. Keith Kowalczyk, a urologist at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, said that based on available information it appeared that Melania Trump was treated for a benign tumor known as an angiomyolipoma. “It’s the most common benign tumor that’s out there. It is a tumor, which means it’s a growth. There’s no worry for it to spread or metastasize. Once it’s treated, it’s treated,” he said. Kowalczyk said women in their mid to late 40s make up 80 to 90 percent of the cases of angiomyolipomas. “It kind of all fits. But I don’t know. Any time you are doing an embolization, it’s because something might bleed. She’s young and healthy and I can’t really think of any other reason you would embolize someone like that.” Kowalczyk said angiomyolipomas are most commonly found by chance. “Usually, with embolization there is over a 90 percent success rate,” he said.  The Slovenian-born first lady last week rolled out an agenda for her White House work focused on helping children. A CNN/SSRS poll found last week that Melania was viewed favorably by 57 percent of Americans, up from 47 percent in January. Her husband’s job approval rating lags behind hers at 50 percent or less.

One was an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation. Another was an emissary for two wealthy Arab princes. The third was a Republican donor with a controversial past in the Middle East as a private security contractor.The meeting was convened primarily to offer help to the Trump team, and it forged relationships between the men and Trump insiders that would develop over the coming months ‚ past the election and well into President Trump‚s first year in office, according to several people with knowledge of their encounters.Erik Prince, the private security contractor and the former head of Blackwater, arranged the meeting, which took place on Aug. 3, 2016. The emissary, George Nader, told Donald Trump Jr. that the princes who led Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were eager to help his father win election as president. The social media specialist, Joel Zamel, extolled his company‚s ability to give an edge to a political campaign; by that time, the firm had already drawn up a multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort to help elect Mr. Trump. The company, which employed several Israeli former intelligence officers, specialized in collecting information and shaping opinion through social media. It is unclear whether such a proposal was executed, and the details of who commissioned it remain in dispute. But Donald Trump Jr. responded approvingly, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting, and after those initial offers of help, Mr. Nader was quickly embraced as a close ally by Trump campaign advisers ‚ meeting frequently with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump‚s son-in-law, and Michael T. Flynn, who became the president‚s first national security adviser. At the time, Mr. Nader was also promoting a secret plan to use private contractors to destabilize Iran, the regional nemesis of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates.After Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Nader paid Mr. Zamel a large sum of money, described by one associate as up to $2 million. There are conflicting accounts of the reason for the payment, but among other things, a company linked to Mr. Zamel provided Mr. Nader with an elaborate presentation about the significance of social media campaigning to Mr. Trump‚s victory.The meetings, which have not been reported previously, are the first indication that countries other than Russia may have offered assistance to the Trump campaign in the months before the presidential election. The interactions are a focus of the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who was originally tasked with examining possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia in the election.Mr. Nader is cooperating with the inquiry, and investigators have questioned numerous witnesses in Washington, New York, Atlanta, Tel Aviv and elsewhere about what foreign help may have been pledged or accepted, and about whether any such assistance was coordinated with Russia, according to witnesses and others with knowledge of the interviews. The interviews, some in recent weeks, are further evidence that special counsel‚s investigation remains in an intense phase even as Mr. Trump‚s lawyers are publicly calling for Mr. Mueller to bring it to a close.It is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in American elections, and it is unclear what ‚ if any ‚ direct assistance Saudi Arabia and the Emirates may have provided. But two people familiar with the meetings said that Trump campaign officials did not appear bothered by the idea of cooperation with foreigners.A lawyer for Donald Trump Jr., Alan Futerfas, said in a statement that ‚prior to the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr. recalls a meeting with Erik Prince, George Nader and another individual who may be Joel Zamel. They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it.‚The August 2016 meeting has echoes of another Trump Tower meeting two months earlier, also under scrutiny by the special counsel, when Donald Trump Jr. and other top campaign aides met with a Russian lawyer after being promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton. No evidence has emerged suggesting that the August meeting was set up with a similar premise. The revelations about the meetings come in the midst of new scrutiny about ties between Mr. Trump‚s advisers and at least three wealthy Persian Gulf states. Besides his interest in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, Mr. Mueller has also been asking witnesses about meetings between White House advisers and representatives of Qatar, Saudi Arabia‚s bitter rival. A lawyer for Mr. Zamel denied that his client had carried out any campaign on Mr. Trump‚s behalf. ‚Neither Joel Zamel, nor any of his related entities, had any involvement whatsoever in the U.S. election campaign,‚ said the lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey.‚The D.O.J. clarified from Day 1 that Joel and his companies have never been a target of the investigation. My client provided full cooperation to the government to assist with their investigation,‚ he said.Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer for Mr. Nader, said, ‚Mr. Nader has fully cooperated with the special counsel‚s investigation and will continue to do so.‚ A senior official in Saudi Arabia said it had never employed Mr. Nader in any capacity or authorized him to speak for the crown prince. Mr. Prince, through a spokesman, declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Advisers to the CourtCrown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, the king‚s main adviser, had long opposed many of the Obama administration‚s policies toward the Middle East. They resented President Barack Obama‚s agreement with Iran over its nuclear program, his statements of support for the Arab Spring uprisings and his hands-off approach to the Syrian civil war.News outlets linked to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates fiercely criticized Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump‚s Democratic opponent, when she was secretary of state, and diplomats familiar with their thinking say both princes hoped for a president who would take a stronger hand in the region against both Iran and groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr. Nader had worked for years as a close adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed of Abu Dhabi, and Mr. Zamel had worked for the Emirati royal court as a consultant as well. When Mr. Trump locked up the Republican presidential nomination in early 2016, Mr. Nader began making inquiries on behalf of the Emirati prince about possible ways to directly support Mr. Trump, according to three people with whom Mr. Nader discussed his efforts. Mr. Nader also visited Moscow at least twice during the presidential campaign as a confidential emissary from Crown Prince Mohammed of Abu Dhabi, according to people familiar with his travels. After the election, he worked with the crown prince to arrange a meeting in the Seychelles between Mr. Prince and a financier close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Companies connected to Mr. Zamel also have ties to Russia. One of his firms had previously worked for oligarchs linked to Mr. Putin, including Oleg V. Deripaska and Dmitry Rybolovlev, who hired the firm for online campaigns against their business rivals.Mr. Deripaska, an aluminum magnate, was once in business with the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty in the special counsel investigation to charges of financial crimes and failing to disclose the lobbying work he did on behalf of a former president of Ukraine, an ally of Mr. Putin. Mr. Rybolovlev once purchased a Florida mansion from Mr. Trump.Mr. Nader‚s visits to Russia and the work Mr. Zamel‚s companies did for the Russians have both been a subject of interest to the special counsel‚s investigators, according to people familiar with witness interviews. A String of MeetingsMr. Zamel and Mr. Nader were together at a Midtown Manhattan hotel at about 4 p.m. on the afternoon of Aug. 3 when Mr. Nader received a call from Mr. Prince summoning them to Trump Tower. When they arrived, Stephen Miller, a top campaign aide who is now a White House adviser, was in Donald Trump Jr.‚s office as well, according to the people familiar with the meeting.Mr. Prince is a longtime Republican donor and the brother of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Mr. Prince and Mr. Nader had known each other since Mr. Nader had worked for Blackwater as a business agent in Iraq in the years after the American invasion. Mr. Prince has longstanding ties to the Emirates, and has frequently done business with Crown Prince Mohammed.Mr. Prince opened the meeting by telling Donald Trump Jr. that ‚we are working hard for your father,‚ in reference to his family and other donors, according to a person familiar with the meeting. He then introduced Mr. Nader as an old friend with deep ties to Arab leaders.Mr. Nader repeatedly referred to the Saudi and Emirati princes as ‚my friends,‚ according to one person with knowledge of the conversation. To underscore the point, he would open his mobile phone to show off pictures of him posing with them, some of which The New York Times obtained. Mr. Nader explained to Donald Trump Jr. that the two princes saw the elder Mr. Trump as a strong leader who would fill the power vacuum that they believed Mr. Obama had left in the Middle East, and Mr. Nader went on to say that he and his friends would be glad to support Mr. Trump as much as they could, according to the person with knowledge of the conversation.Mr. Zamel, for his part, laid out the capabilities of his online media company, although it is unclear whether he referred to the proposals his company had already prepared. One person familiar with the meeting said that Mr. Nader invited Donald Trump Jr. to meet with a Saudi prince ‚ an invitation the younger Mr. Trump declined. After about half an hour, everyone exchanged business cards. ‚There was a brief meeting, nothing concrete was offered or pitched to anyone and nothing came of it,‚ said Mr. Mukasey, the lawyer for Mr. Zamel.By then, a company connected to Mr. Zamel had been working on a proposal for a covert multimillion-dollar online manipulation campaign to help elect Mr. Trump, according to three people involved and a fourth briefed on the effort. The plan involved using thousands of fake social media accounts to promote Mr. Trump‚s candidacy on platforms like Facebook. There were concerns inside the company, Psy-Group, about the plan‚s legality, according to one person familiar with the effort. The company, whose motto is ‚shape reality,‚ consulted an American law firm, and was told that it would be illegal if any non-Americans were involved in the effort.Mr. Zamel, the founder of Psy-Group and one of its owners, has been questioned about the August 2016 meeting by investigators for the special counsel, and at least two F.B.I. agents working on the inquiry have traveled to Israel to interview employees of the company who worked on the proposal. According to one person, the special counsel‚s team has worked with the Israeli police to seize the computers of one of Mr. Zamel‚s companies, which is currently in liquidation.In the hectic final weeks of the campaign and during the presidential transition, several of Mr. Trump‚s advisers drew Mr. Nader close. He met often with Mr. Kushner, Mr. Flynn and Stephen K. Bannon, who took over as campaign chairman after Mr. Manafort resigned amid revelations about his work in Ukraine.In December 2016, Mr. Nader turned again to an internet company linked to Mr. Zamel ‚ WhiteKnight, based in the Philippines ‚ to purchase a presentation demonstrating the impact of social media campaigns on Mr. Trump‚s electoral victory. Asked about the purchase, a representative of WhiteKnight said: ‚WhiteKnight delivers premium research and high-end business development services for prestigious clients around the world. WhiteKnight does not talk about any of its clients.‚ After the inauguration, both Mr. Zamel and Mr. Nader visited the White House, meeting with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bannon.At that time, Mr. Nader was promoting a plan to use private contractors to carry out economic sabotage against Iran that, he hoped, might coerce it to permanently abandon its nuclear program. The plan included efforts to deter Western companies from investing in Iran, and operations to sow mistrust among Iranian officials. He advocated the project, which he estimated would cost about $300 million, to American, Emirati and Saudi officials.Last spring, Mr. Nader traveled to Riyadh for meetings with senior Saudi military and intelligence officials to pitch his Iran sabotage plan. He was convinced, according to several people familiar with his plan, that economic warfare was the key to the overthrow of the government in Tehran. One person briefed on Mr. Nader‚s activities said he tried to persuade Mr. Kushner to endorse the plan to Crown Prince Mohammed in person on a trip to Riyadh, although it was unclear whether the message was delivered.Asked about Mr. Nader‚s plans to attack Iran, the senior Saudi official said Mr. Nader had a habit of pitching proposals that went nowhere.Mr. Nader was also in discussions with Mr. Prince, the former head of Blackwater, about a plan to get the Saudis to pay $2 billion to set up a private army to combat Iranian proxy forces in Yemen.Since entering the White House, Mr. Trump has allied himself closely with Saudi Arabia and the Emirates. His first overseas trip was to Riyadh. He strongly backed Saudi and Emirati efforts to isolate their neighbor Qatar, another American ally, even over apparent disagreement from the State and Defense Departments.This month, Mr. Trump also withdrew from an Obama administration nuclear deal with Iran that both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had campaigned against for years, delivering them their biggest victory yet from his administration.",Trump Jr. and Other Aides Met With Gulf Emissary Offering Help to Win Election,"May 19, 2018 /  7:07 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-election/update-1-trump-jr-met-gulf-princes-emissary-in-2016-who-offered-campaign-help-idUSL2N1SQ0B4,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump Jr., the U.S. president’s eldest son, met in August 2016 with an envoy representing the crown princes of United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The meeting was first reported by the New York Times on Saturday and confirmed by an attorney representing Trump Jr. The meeting was a chance for the envoy to offer help to the Trump presidential campaign, according to The New York Times.      The newspaper said the meeting, held on Aug. 3, 2016, was arranged by Erik Prince, the founder and former head of private military contractor Blackwater, who attended the meeting. Joel Zamel, a co-founder of an Israeli consulting firm, was also in attendance. Alan Futerfas, Trump Jr.’s attorney, said on Saturday that nothing came of the meeting. “Prior to the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr. recalls a meeting with Erik Prince, George Nader and another individual who may be Joel Zamel,” Futerfas said in an emailed statement. “They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it.” A company connected to Zamel also worked on a proposal for a “covert multimillion-dollar online manipulation campaign” to help Trump, utilizing thousands of fake social media accounts, the New York Times report said. The envoy, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, told Trump, Jr. that the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE were eager to help his father win the 2016 presidential election, the paper said. Since 1974, the United States has barred foreign nationals from giving money to political campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties. The campaign financing laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate. The Saudi and UAE embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal last month reported that investigators working for U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had met with Zamel, and that Mueller’s team was looking into his firm’s work and his relationship with Nader. Mueller is investigating whether Russia meddled in the presidential election and if Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign, as well as whether Trump committed obstruction of justice by trying to thwart the U.S. Department of Justice probe. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt.” The New York Times report said the meetings are an indication that other countries besides Russia may have offered help to Trump’s presidential campaign. Mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses in Washington, New York, Atlanta, Tel Aviv and elsewhere regarding possible foreign help to the campaign, the report said. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller’s team, declined to comment on the report. Zamel’s attorney, Marc Mukasey, said in a statement to Reuters that his client “offered nothing to the Trump campaign, received nothing from the Trump campaign, delivered nothing to the Trump campaign and was not solicited by, or asked to do anything for, the Trump campaign.” “Media reports about Mr. Zamel’s engaging in ‘social media manipulation’ are uninformed,” Mukasey added. “Mr. Zamel’s companies harvest publicly available information for lawful use.” Kathryn Ruemmler, Nader’s lawyer, told the paper that her client “has fully cooperated with the U.S. special counsel’s investigation and will continue to do so.” Erik Prince, who is also the brother of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, could not be immediately reached for comment.

3343835,511,['2018-05-20t21:43:45.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/business/media/comcast-fox-disney.html,"On Wednesday, Comcast confirmed in a statement that it was in the ‚advanced stages of preparing‚  its own bid for the 21st Century Fox assets that Walt Disney has agreed to buy.LOS ANGELES ‚ As empires hang in the balance, two hardened commanders engage in tug of war on an epic scale.It could be the plot of a summer blockbuster ‚ the latest ‚Star Wars‚ movie, perhaps. Instead, it may soon play out in real life, with Comcast, led by Brian L. Roberts, trying to pry the bulk of 21st Century Fox away from Disney and its chief executive, Robert A. Iger. ‚It will be a bloody battle,‚ said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst.The Walt Disney Company struck a $52.4 billion, all-stock deal in December to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the global conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch. Regulators are now scrutinizing the transaction; Fox and Disney shareholders are expected to vote on the agreement sometime this summer. Comcast had also pursued Fox, making a proposal in the fall that exceeded Disney‚s bid by 16 percent on a per-share basis. The Fox board cut off talks over antitrust concerns. At the time, the Justice Department had just filed a lawsuit to block AT&T‚s $85.4 billion offer for Time Warner.But Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, thinks it has a new opening.Media and legal experts believe that AT&T will win its fight for Time Warner. The government did not appear to prove its case that a bulked-up AT&T would harm consumers and stifle competition. A judge will rule by June 12.If the outcome is favorable to AT&T, Comcast intends to mount a campaign to snatch Fox from Disney, according to two people briefed on the strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Comcast is likely to offer roughly $60 billion for Mr. Murdoch‚s assets ‚ in cash ‚ while matching other terms of the Disney deal (laid out in a recent securities filing) and making a public case to Fox shareholders that regulatory concerns have vastly lessened.Cue the battle royale.Here is what you need to know as the tension mounts.How serious is Comcast about a potential hostile bid?Extremely. Contrary to the belief of some in Hollywood, this is not about casual rumblings from the Comcast camp as a way to torment Mr. Iger. Comcast is mobilizing. It has already lined up bridge financing with investment banks, for instance, according to the people briefed on the company‚s strategy. At the same time, it‚s possible nothing comes of that maneuvering. Comcast, which declined to comment, is waiting for the outcome of the AT&T case to make up its mind. Exactly what are the Fox assets?Under his deal with Disney, Mr. Murdoch is selling stakes in two behemoth overseas television providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India; a portion of Hulu; the cable channels FX and National Geographic; a chain of 22 regional cable networks dedicated to sports; a television studio with more than 30 series in production; and the 20th Century Fox movie studio, which controls the ‚Avatar‚ and ‚X-Men‚ franchises.Fox News, the Fox broadcast network, a chain of local television stations and the FS1 sports network are not for sale. Mr. Murdoch is building a new company around those.Why does Comcast want the Fox assets so badly?It boils down to this: Comcast, like Disney, wants to add bulk as a counterattack against Netflix and other tech giants that have aggressively moved into the entertainment business.‚There will only be a handful of global, scale players,‚ Todd Juenger, an analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a research report on May 9. ‚We think Disney and Comcast increasingly view Fox as the seminal defining point, and this the moment in time, in determining which company ascends to that role.‚Comcast, the largest cable and broadband provider in the United States, wants Mr. Murdoch‚s overseas businesses in particular ‚ so much so that it made a $31 billion offer last month for the 61 percent of Sky that Fox doesn‚t already own. NBCUniversal has been white hot ‚ revenue soared 21 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier ‚ and its portfolio includes the fastest-growing cable network (MSNBC) and the No. 1 cable entertainment network (USA). In the longer term, however, NBCUniversal likely needs a bigger content war chest to compete against Netflix, Amazon, Apple and their ilk.How is Disney likely to respond to a Comcast bid?Mr. Iger has given no public indication, and a Disney spokeswoman declined to comment.But analysts predict scorched earth. Disney could sweeten its bid, resurface horror stories about Comcast‚s customer service, remind Fox shareholders that Disney‚s regulatory process will be faster ‚ it has a six-month head start ‚ and raise questions about whether Comcast adhered to conditions the government put on past acquisitions, like NBCUniversal.Comcast has some deal baggage. A 2015 attempt to buy Time Warner Cable collapsed under pressure from regulators, who found that the combined company would have had the power and incentive to inhibit the future of streaming video.Some lawmakers have continued to scrutinize Comcast‚s 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal. In a letter to the Justice Department in December, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked for a renewed investigation on the effects of that purchase, writing that it ‚has been roundly criticized by experts who argue that it has caused anticompetitive harm.‚Comcast said at the time, in part, that it had ‚met or exceeded all of the commitments and obligations‚ set forth by the Justice Department for the NBCUniversal transaction. If the AT&T deal goes through, does that mean easy regulatory sailing for a potential Comcast-Fox union? No. Timothy Horan, an analyst at Oppenheimer who has expressed support for a Comcast move on Fox, wrote in a May 9 research note that approval for the AT&T deal would help open a regulatory path but that Comcast would still face a ‚difficult‚ road.Antitrust experts note that Comcast-Fox would have more overlapping businesses than AT&T-Time Warner. Comcast-Fox would also control more of the overall entertainment supply chain ‚ ‚a content and distribution superpower like we‚ve ever seen,‚ as Mr. Nathanson put it in a phone interview.Comcast has a bigger broadband business than AT&T, which could raise government concerns that Comcast could use that power to hurt competitors, especially as the internet grows in importance as a video pipe, some analysts say.Disney has its own regulatory risks in buying the Fox businesses. The melding of ESPN, already owned by Disney, with Mr. Murdoch‚s regional sports networks may be an issue for the government. Disney would also become a movie colossus; based on 2017 ticket sales, Disney-Fox would control about 35 percent of the domestic theatrical business.Comcast shares have dropped 24 percent since late January. Does the apparent lack of shareholder support for a Fox bid mean Comcast will back off?No. Comcast does not need shareholder approval for a cash offer. Moreover, Comcast executives probably see the decline as temporary and not entirely related to the hostile bid rumblings. Comcast‚s cable competitor Charter has seen its shares decline about 28 percent over the same period. Does Comcast have the money to make a hostile bid?The company would borrow to make a cash offer, and banks are willing. Comcast has healthy financials.It would, however, mean taking on an amount of debt ‚ at least $164 billion ‚ that Moody‚s last week called ‚staggering‚ and said would probably imperil Comcast‚s A3 credit rating.‚That sounds like a nearly impossible level of debt to sustain,‚ Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research, wrote in a recent report. But he argued that it was not as scary upon a closer look. Given Fox synergies and cash flow, ‚Net debt by the end of 2020 would drop to below $130 billion ‚ essentially in line with a combined AT&T Time Warner.‚Where does this leave Fox shareholders?In the catbird seat. Even if Disney ultimately wins ‚ as Mr. Nathanson predicts ‚ Comcast can drive up the price.For his part, Mr. Murdoch has made no public comment about a potential bid by Comcast. (His family‚s share of the vote is about 17 percent.) Lachlan Murdoch, chairman of 21st Century Fox, told analysts on a May 10 earnings call, ‚We are committed to our agreement with Disney.‚He added, ‚Our directors, though, of course, are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.‚","As Disney Moves Forward With Fox, Comcast Continues Plotting","June 13, 2018 /  8:10 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-comcast/comcast-offers-65-billion-to-lure-fox-from-disney-bid-idUSKBN1J92Z2,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) offered $65 billion on Wednesday to lure Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) away from a merger with Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), setting up a bidding war between two of the largest U.S. media companies with its 20 percent higher offer. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said he was highly confident regulators would allow Comcast to acquire most of Fox’s media assets after AT&T Inc’s (T.N) court victory on Tuesday, which allowed it to buy Time Warner Inc TWX.N for $85 billion. The fight to win Fox’s assets is shaping up to be a summer blockbuster starring well-known media moguls, led by Rupert Murdoch who built Fox into a global media empire. Comcast’s Roberts, who led a failed bid for Disney in 2004, now faces off against Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger, whose own dealmaking has added heroes from Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel comics to the home of Mickey Mouse. Fox’s board will now have to decide whether Comcast’s offer beats Disney’s. If Fox prefers Comcast, Disney will have five business days to respond. Comcast may have a tough time winning over Fox’s largest shareholder, the Murdoch family. They own a 17-percent stake and would face a multi-billion dollar capital gains tax bill by accepting an all-cash offer from Comcast, tax experts previously told Reuters.   Fox shareholders will vote July 10 on the Disney transaction but the company could postpone the meeting, Fox said in a statement. Some analysts see difficulties for Comcast-Fox, which would add Fox’s movie and television studios to Comcast’s NBC Universal, but Roberts said in a letter to Fox that he would offer the same conditions as Disney and promised to fight for the deal in court if necessary. Comcast is expected to lead a wave of traditional media companies trying to combine distribution and production to compete with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google. The younger firms produce content, sell it online directly to consumers and often offer lucrative targeted advertising. A merger between Fox and Comcast would create a company with a stable of well-known media brands and franchises, such as the X-Men superheroes. A combined company would hold the rights to air Fox’s long running TV show “The Simpsons”, the U.S. rights to the Olympics and Premier League Soccer.  Fox’s international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence. Major sports and news assets including Fox News, Fox Business Network and Fox Sports would be spun off into a separate company. Slideshow (8 Images)Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney were barely changed in after-hours trade. Comcast in a statement outlined an offer that was similar to Disney’s, including a commitment to the same divestitures. It said that it would go to court and fight if the Justice Department tried to block the deal. Comcast offered $35 per Fox share for the media assets, compared with Disney’s stock offer, worth $29.18 per share at the close of trade on Wednesday.  Comcast offered a $2.5 billion reverse termination fee if the deal did not go through, the same as Disney. It also offered to pay Fox’s $1.525 billion breakup fee owed Disney, if Fox went with Comcast. Comcast said it intended to pursue its $30 billion acquisition of Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in parallel with its Fox bid. Comcast bid for Sky in April, after Fox’s bid for the remainder of European pay-TV group it did not already own was delayed by regulators. Fox in a statement said it had received the proposal and would review it. Justice Department lawyers who tried to stop AT&T’s $85 billion deal expect consumers will lose out as bigger companies raise prices, and some lawyers saw that as a concern in a Comcast-Fox deal which would put two movie studios and two major television brands under one roof. “One cannot ignore the fact that there’s less independent content to go around,” after the AT&T deal, said Henry Su, an antitrust expert with Constantine Cannon LLP. Still, the AT&T court fight gave Comcast valuable information about how to structure a Fox deal, said David Scharf, a litigation expert with Morrison Cohen. Disney itself has “surgically” structured a transaction that “might be doable,” avoiding Fox Broadcasting and big Fox sports channels, U.S. antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said last week. “I don’t think either will have a significant advantage over the other,” given that both Disney and Comcast seem motivated to divest what they need to win a deal with Fox, said Ketan Jhaveri, a former Justice Department attorney who served on the telecommunications task force.

Justify‚s ownership group ‚ WinStar Farm, China Horse Club, Head of Plains Partners and Starlight Racing ‚ also owns the third-place Kentucky Derby finisher Audible, perhaps Justify‚s biggest foe as he takes aim at becoming the 13th Triple Crown winner and the first since American Pharoah in 2015. My Boy Jack, the fifth-place Derby finisher, is co-owned by Sol Kumin, who also runs Head of Plains.Elliott Walden, the president and chief executive of WinStar, said the group needed more time to think about whether they wanted to risk spoiling their own Triple Crown party. Kumin said the same.On Sunday morning, Justify said goodbye to Pimlico Race Course and headed back to Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., where he will prepare for the mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes on June 9 in New York. He showed no signs of discomfort from a hoof bruise that developed after the Kentucky Derby. Still, there is a long road ahead. ‚I don‚t see why we wouldn‚t go to the Belmont as long as he stays like this,‚ the trainer Bob Baffert said of his undefeated colt. ‚He looks good. He looks pretty bright. He ate everything. No foot issues today.‚Already lined up to face Justify are Bravazo and Tenfold, second and third in the Preakness; Blended Citizen, the winner of the Peter Pan Stakes; Hofburg, seventh in the Kentucky Derby; Vino Rosso, ninth in the Derby; and Free Drop Billy, 16th in the Derby.Justify, ridden by Mike Smith, faced a considerable challenge from the Derby runner-up Good Magic throughout the mile-and-three-sixteenths Preakness Stakes. As Justify emerged from the heavy fog and appeared to pull away, Bravazo and Tenfold sneaked up to finish second and third, a neck apart. Good Magic, who is not under consideration for the Belmont, finished a length behind, in fourth.Baffert equaled the record of 14 victories in Triple Crown races, matching Bravazo‚s 82-year-old trainer, D. Wayne Lukas. Lukas said he was pleased with the gritty performance by his colt, who improved from his sixth-place finish in the Derby.‚If you can be satisfied with second, I am,‚ he said. ‚I‚m so competitive that second is not good enough in my mind-set, but having said that, if you can handle second, it was a damn good one.‚ Meanwhile, the fate of Pimlico Race Course, which hosted the 143rd running of the race on Saturday, is yet to be decided. The Maryland Stadium Authority is conducting a study, expected to be completed by the end of the year, on the dilapidated racetrack‚s ability to serve as the continued home for the Preakness.The Stronach Group, which owns the racetrack, has strongly hinted at wanting to move the race to Laurel Park, another track it owns that is about halfway between Baltimore and Washington.Belinda Stronach, the chairwoman and president of the group, said the company was committed to racing in Maryland and that the goal was to race year-round at one venue and attract big events, like the Breeders‚ Cup.‚We continue to invest and make the repairs necessary for the structure,‚ Stronach said of Pimlico. ‚We also are cooperating with the Maryland Stadium Authority, and we look forward to what they have to say, and that will help inform where we go in the future.‚Now all eyes will be on the Belmont Stakes, which will again have a capped attendance of 90,000 after California Chrome‚s failed attempt to claim a Triple Crown in 2014 drew 102,199 people, many of whom were left unsatisfied because of long lines at concession stands and betting windows, a lack of food and drinks late in the day, and post-race transportation blunders.Baffert tried and failed to pull off Triple Crown sweeps with the Derby and Preakness winners Silver Charm in 1997, Real Quiet in 1998 and War Emblem in 2002.

Jun 7, 2018; Elmont, NY, USA; Triple crown contender Justify is given a bath after his morning work out at Belmont Park. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsTo be successful, he’ll have to beat nine other 3-year-old equine athletes in the 1 1/2-mile race at expansive Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y., the largest oval of any thoroughbred racetrack in North America. If Justify does so, he’ll be just the second horse in history to win the Triple Crown without tasting defeat — the first was the legendary Seattle Slew in 1977. The Belmont Stakes is the longest of the Triple Crown races, one lap around the main track with a stretch ending in front of a huge and boisterous grandstand full of fans anxious to witness history. It will be the only time Justify, or any of those lined up to try to stop his run to immortality, ever races that far. Justify, the burly chestnut son of Scat Daddy out of the Ghostzapper mare Stage Magic, already has proven his mettle, as he became the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby without a start at 2 since Apollo in 1882. He followed that historical win with another in the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore three weeks ago but is up against another barrier Saturday in the suburbs of the Big Apple: No horse has ever captured the Triple Crown without having started at age 2. “It’s been an incredible journey,” Justify’s trainer, Bob Baffert, said Wednesday. “It’s been quick. He’s handled everything thrown at him without losing his composure. A lot of horses get nervous, hot. Justify thrives on this. “Not only is he a great athlete, but he has a great mind. In the Derby, the Preakness, he was in the paddock like he’d handled it all before. He’s a very fearless type of horse.” If Justify wins, he will set a record for the most opponents beaten in a Belmont Stakes with a Triple Crown at stake, a remarkable achievement considering he didn’t compete in a race until Feb. 18. If he loses, he will join an even longer list, becoming the 21st horse since 1944 — and the 13th since 1979 — to win the Derby and Preakness and fall short when competing in the Belmont. Justify is owned by China Horse Club, Head of Plains Partners LLC, Starlight Racing and WinStar Farm. His lifetime earnings are now more than $2.9 million. A New York Times report last week said Justify’s breeding rights have been sold to Coolmore Stud for $60 million, a figure that was negotiated before the colt won the Preakness. The same report claims that figure will increase by $25 million if Justify wins the Triple Crown. Justify looked right at home on the track during his first workout at Belmont on Thursday, moving around briskly and galloping with authority. He still looks as though he’s carrying good weight, and there are no signs that the demanding road to win three Grade 1 races on three tracks at three distances in just five weeks have worn him down. Both the Derby and the Preakness — as well as the Santa Anita Derby prior to the Triple Crown races - were run on off tracks, meaning the surfaces were affected by rain. Those conditions are obviously to Justify’s liking. The forecast for Saturday calls for a 40 percent chance of afternoon showers, with a high of 79 degrees. Justify has drawn the rail and the No. 1 post position and will most likely use his speed to get the lead under jockey Mike Smith and try to outlast any other horse who tries to go with him or run him down in the stretch. As for those that will try to beat Justify in the Belmont, six have run against him in one of the other Triple Crown races. Those most likely to take a run at stopping Justify are Hofburg, who was a troubled seventh in the Derby; Noble Indy and Vino Rosso, trained by three-time Belmont winner Todd Pletcher; and Bravazo and Tenfold, both beaten less than a length by Justify in the Preakness. Hofburg will be the second choice to Justify. His trainer, Hall of Famer Bill Mott, won the Belmont in 2010 with Drosselmeyer. “Our horse has plenty of stamina,” Mott said. “That’s his forte. He keeps coming. He fits the profile of a horse who’ll like the Belmont. I have a lot of respect for Justify. It’s a major challenge to beat him. But you can’t let him go around by himself.” The other three runners are making their first appearance in a Triple Crown race. Blended Citizen comes off a victory over this track in the Peter Pan Stakes on May 12. Restoring Hope, also trained by Baffert, is still eligible for a first-level allowance and is running at the urging of owner Gary West. Gronkowski, sure to take money being named for and now co-owned by tight end Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots, is making his first start since being imported to the United States and turned over to trainer Chad Brown. He will race on Lasix for the first time. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Justify roaring and ready to claim Triple Crown at Belmont Stakes,W

Justify was installed as a 4-5 morning line favorite during a draw that was held on Tuesday at the home of Major League Baseball’s New York Mets. The chestnut son of Scat Daddy needs a victory in the 1-1/2 mile (2.4 km) race to become the 13th Triple Crown winner and first since American Pharoah in 2015 to win the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes. Ridden by Mike Smith and trained by Hall of Famer Bob Baffert, Justify has only run five races in his career and will be tested by some fresher horses in the Belmont Stakes, which has often ended the dreams of many Triple Crown hopefuls. “I never do like to draw the rail, but my horses seem to live in it,” said Baffert who trained the most recent Triple Crown winner. “I just feel that, I think most importantly, the horse is doing well. ... We have it. We can’t change it. So we’ll just deal with it.” Triple Crown hopeful Justify gets bathed after arriving at his stable at Belmont Park racetrack in Elmont, New York, U.S., June 7, 2018.  REUTERS/Shannon StapletonJustify will line up with nine horses to his right as part of a field that includes five horses he beat during a rain-soaked Kentucky Derby and two he beat at a wet and foggy Preakness Stakes. Hofburg, who is trained by William I Mott and ridden by Irad Ortiz, drew the fourth post and is the second choice at 9-2. Preakness runner-up Bravazo, the only other horse besides Justify who will be competing in each leg of the Triple Crown, and Vino Rosso were both were installed at 8-1 while the rest of the field is 12-1 or longer.

Bob Baffert-trained Justify arrived in town on Wednesday ahead of his attempt to become the 13th horse to complete the triple crown, and the second in four years, after American Pharoah in 2015. Showers are possible for the 1 1/2 mile (2400m) race on the Belmont Park dirt in Elmont, New York. The Belmont Stakes, to be held for the 150th time, is the longest of the triple crown races.  Justify won the Kentucky Derby by 2 1/2 lengths and triumphed narrowly at the Preakness Stakes — both races run in sloppy conditions. “I think he’s got to run better than he did in the Preakness but we know going in he’s got the most talent,” NBC horse racing analyst Randy Moss said on Friday. Justify had never raced until February. Should he win, he will be only the second undefeated horse to complete the triple crown, joining Seattle Slew (1977). Ridden by two-times Belmont Stakes winning jockey Mike Smith, Justify has drawn the inside barrier. After wearing mainly white silks in the previous two triple crown races, Smith on Saturday will don the colors — red with yellow stars — of the China Horse Club, part owner of the three-year-old colt. Hofburg, a 9/2 shot ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr., is rated by punters as the most likely to beat Justify. He has not run since a seventh placing at the Kentucky Derby five weeks ago. Bravazo and Vino Rosso, both 8/1, are also considered legitimate threats. Luis Saez-ridden Bravazo nearly ran down a fading Justify in the final yards of the Preakness before finishing second, a half-length behind. Vino Rosso, ridden by John Velazquez, had a bad start at the Kentucky Derby but battled on to finish ninth after starting from a wide barrier.

The Maryland Stadium Authority is conducting a study, expected to be completed by the end of the year, on the dilapidated racetrack‚s ability to serve as the continued home for the Preakness.The Stronach Group, which owns the racetrack, has strongly hinted at wanting to move the race to Laurel Park, another track it owns that is about halfway between Baltimore and Washington.Belinda Stronach, the chairwoman and president of the group, said the company was committed to racing in Maryland and that the goal was to race year-round at one venue and attract big events, like the Breeders‚ Cup.‚We continue to invest and make the repairs necessary for the structure,‚ Stronach said of Pimlico. ‚We also are cooperating with the Maryland Stadium Authority, and we look forward to what they have to say, and that will help inform where we go in the future.‚Now all eyes will be on the Belmont Stakes, which will again have a capped attendance of 90,000 after California Chrome‚s failed attempt to claim a Triple Crown in 2014 drew 102,199 people, many of whom were left unsatisfied because of long lines at concession stands and betting windows, a lack of food and drinks late in the day, and post-race transportation blunders.Baffert tried and failed to pull off Triple Crown sweeps with the Derby and Preakness winners Silver Charm in 1997, Real Quiet in 1998 and War Emblem in 2002.

The favored three-year-old chestnut colt seized an early lead he never relinquished as he stormed around the 1.5 mile (12-furlong) course in two minutes 28.18 seconds for the wire-to-wire win at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. The 24-1 long-shot Gronkowski battled from the back of the pack to cross the line second, almost two lengths behind Justify, while the 5-1 Hofburg finished third amid overcast but dry conditions. The victory marks the second Triple Crown win for Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert, who also won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes with American Pharoah in 2015.  “This never gets old,” an emotional Baffert said after the race.      “American Pharoah, he’ll always be my first love. For this horse to do it for (jockey) Mike Smith, he deserved something like this. It feels pretty good.” Related CoverageFactbox: Triple Crown winner JustifyBaffert said Justify was simply the best horse at the track on Saturday. “He could have won every race on the undercard today, he’s just that kind of horse.”  The large and muscular Justify, owned by China Horse Club, Head of Plains Partners, Starlight Racing & WinStar Farm, made 52-year-old Smith the oldest jockey to ever win the Triple Crown.  “This horse ran a tremendous race. He’s so gifted he’s sent from heaven,” Smith said of Justify, who was the 4/5 favorite.

Greg Abbott in the lobby of Arcadia First Baptist Church here Sunday morning.Her message was simple: The violence was not ‚a political issue,‚ she told Mr. Abbott, explaining to reporters afterward that schools needed to be safer but restricting the availability of guns was not the way to achieve it.After the February rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., students there helped ignite the most successful push for action on gun control in decades in that state. There is little indication of anything similar in Texas, a place where guns are hard-wired into the state‚s psyche, Republicans control virtually all the levers of power, and where the victims of Friday‚s rampage in a conservative rural area are showing little of the anti-gun fervor that followed the Parkland shooting in a more diverse, suburban one.In the wake of the tragedy, gun issues are likely to take on a new urgency in a few Texas political races, including Republican congressional districts that Democrats are trying to flip, but the debate is far more muted and dominated by support for gun rights than it had been in Florida post-Parkland.‚Florida is a swing state,‚ said Calvin Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ‚You start with the understanding that Florida is a purple state in which Democrats and Republicans are both competitive. Texas is a deep-red state, in which the Republican Party is in complete and total control. They don‚t feel that partisan electoral heat.‚What played out instead was a reminder, as happened after 26 people were killed in a church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November, that major gun violence often does not produce a backlash against guns. The differences in how the issue has played out in Texas and Florida illustrate just how hard it can be to establish a consensus on gun issues in America. For gun control advocates, what works in one part of the country does not work in others, even down to the vocabulary used. Some pro-gun Texans question the phrase ‚gun violence‚ and avoid using it, saying it is as arbitrary as talking about knife violence.‚People like to say on Facebook, ‚Oh, you shouldn‚t be able to buy a gun,‚‚ Ms. Bracknell told reporters at the church on Sunday, two days after police said a 17-year-old student used a shotgun and handgun, apparently belonging to his father, to kill 10 people, including a substitute teacher, Glenda Ann Perkins, whom Ms. Bracknell had known for years. ‚That kid was 17. He‚s not able to buy a gun anyway. It‚s not like a gun-law issue. This kid is obviously mentally unstable and he knew that there were flaws in the school system to get into the rooms.‚The differences between the fallout from the Florida and the Texas shootings begins with the communities where they occurred. In Florida, parents and students put emotional and public political pressure on lawmakers, and legislators responded just three weeks after the Parkland massacre. The Republican governor of Florida, Rick Scott, signed into law several measures, including raising the minimum age and adding a waiting period to purchase a gun. In Texas, there is no widespread vocal pressure and activism from the families and students themselves. Many Santa Fe students‚ views on guns track Ms. Bracknell‚s.Hours after the shooting on Friday at a prayer vigil, Madilyn Williams, an 18-year-old senior, tearfully told Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, how she and a friend had fled their astronomy class and rushed to a gas station when the shooting started.While some students from Parkland had angrily confronted their pro-gun elected representatives after their school was shot up, Ms. Williams quietly told a nodding Mr. Cruz that she wanted her teachers to be armed. It was a refrain in the candlelit park that night: Stricter gun control laws would not have prevented the shooting, several students said. But they believed that arming qualified teachers could have.‚If one of the teachers had a gun, we would have been a lot better off,‚ Ms. Williams said in an interview.Sid Miller, the state‚s Republican agriculture commissioner and a former rodeo roping champion, said he wanted to apply ‚a little cowboy logic‚ to the gun debate. While Texas may be receptive to certain measures, such as strengthening security in schools, Mr. Miller said, officials will continue to resist other policies championed by national gun control advocates.‚At this stage, any stricter gun control laws passing in Texas, that‚s just not going to happen,‚ said Mr. Miller, a rancher who has a state-issued handgun license and whose combative social media commentary has outraged Democrats. ‚You can‚t protect yourself by taking guns away from the good people.‚There are signs of gun control support in Santa Fe. Students held a small post-Parkland march in February. On Sunday outside the school, near where Mr. Abbott laid flowers in memory of the victims, one handwritten sign read, ‚More peace and love and less guns in this world.‚Tyler Cruz, 18, a senior, said he would support any gun control movement that arises at his school now, but he knows his classmates will be divided. ‚Our community is really pro-gun here,‚ Mr. Cruz said. ‚I‚m pro-gun, but I‚m not. I get the Second Amendment, but I just believe it‚s gotten too far with all this happening.‚Mr. Cruz has drawn support from the shooting survivors in Parkland and has been messaging with four of them on Twitter. Republican leaders in Texas, including Mr. Abbott and Mr. Cruz, have been criticized by Democrats for failing to act in response to the Santa Fe shooting, accusations they dispute. Instead, they and gun advocates nationally talk about a need to act ‚ but not by restricting guns.Since the shooting, gun rights advocates have called for arming teachers, redesigning school buildings and promoting safer gun storage at home to keep firearms out of the hands of children and teenagers.Mr. Abbott has proposed holding round-table discussions, saying he wanted to work on laws that will protect Second Amendment rights while making schools safer. Oliver North, the incoming president of the National Rifle Association, Sunday on Fox News blamed mass shootings on violent movies and overuse of psychiatric drugs like Ritalin.The Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, has called for reducing the number of entrances and exits at schools. On the CNN program ‚State of the Union,‚ Mr. Patrick on Sunday also called on parents to strictly control their guns to keep them out of the hands of children, but he stopped short of calling for specific legislation mandating that.The gun debate here touches on one of the central divides that shapes politics in Texas: the largely Democratic urban areas versus more conservative rural and suburban ones. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, for example, has bitterly denounced inaction on gun issues, and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner called on Sunday for new gun control measures and metal detectors in schools.Santa Fe is a largely rural town in a part of southeast Texas that is home to oil refineries and working-class Republicans who own guns and routinely hunt. The town is only about 40 miles southeast of downtown Houston, but it is closer in its political and social culture to Southern-tinged East Texas. At least a handful of Confederate flags fly around town, on trucks, porches and businesses.Polling shows the state‚s voters are more split on guns than popular culture might indicate. According to an October poll by the University of Texas and The Texas Tribune, more than half of the registered voters surveyed said gun control laws should be stricter. Only 13 percent said the laws should be less strict than they are now, and 31 percent would prefer to leave current gun laws unchanged.But, for now, the pro-gun forces are firmly in control, and deeply conservative voices are not hard to find.As Mr. Patrick greeted parishioners at Arcadia First Baptist Church on Sunday morning, he got an enthusiastic greeting from Robert Ross, 69, who has lived in Santa Fe all his life and has a nephew who once played football with the gunman. Mr. Ross said he believed the solution to school violence was not gun control, but faith. He blamed the shooting on what he called a cultural decay exemplified by legal abortion, gay marriage and the separation of church and state.‚We wonder why this is happening,‚ he said. ‚Satan‚s right there. He‚s always putting his foot in everything.‚",Anti-Gun Backlash From School Shooting? Probably Not in Texas,"May 18, 2018 /  7:34 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-shooting-parkland/do-something-parkland-survivors-urge-action-after-texas-school-shooting-idUSKCN1IJ2LU,"PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - Survivors of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, vowed support on Friday for Texas students caught up in the latest deadly school shooting, saying tighter gun laws were needed to stop further bloodshed.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File PhotoStudents at Santa Fe High School, about 30 miles (48 km) outside Houston, were among the thousands across the country who staged a walkout in April to protest congressional inaction after 17 students and staff members were killed by a former student on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. On Friday, the Texas high school came under attack, with at least 10 people killed by a student gunman, police said. “You deserve more than Thoughts and Prayers, and after supporting us by walking out we will be there to support you by raising up your voices,” Emma Gonzalez, one of the leaders of the Parkland student movement, wrote on Twitter. There was a heavy police presence outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High on Friday, as has been typical since the massacre. Friday’s shooting came on what was the last day of school for many Stoneman Douglas seniors, turning a moment of celebration into another somber reminder of the February attack.  “I should be celebrating my last day of high school, but instead my heart is broken to hear of the tragedy at Santa Fe,” student Delaney Tarr said on Twitter. “We cannot let this continue to be the norm. We cannot.” As school ended for the day hundreds of students, many still wearing controversial clear backpacks ordered for use after the February shooting, streamed onto nearby sidewalks. “It’s crazy how often this is happening,” said sophomore Michael Gregory, 16. “It’s difficult to see this happen in other places because you know what they’re going through, and it shouldn’t be happening.” FILE PHOTO: Emma Gonzalez, a student and shooting survivor from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, cries as she addresses the conclusion of the ""March for Our Lives"" event demanding gun control after recent school shootings at a rally in Washington, DC, U.S., March 24, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File PhotoMany of the Parkland students have become outspoken proponents of gun control, pressuring companies to sever ties with the National Rifle Association and calling on legislators to pass gun safety laws as part of the #NeverAgain movement. They helped lead hundreds of thousands of protesters who participated in the March for Our Lives demonstrations around the country this spring. Student organizers at the school said each tragedy since theirs served as a reminder of the importance - and difficulty - of their efforts. “In a way, we’ve been asleep,” said Daniel Tabares, a freshman who was in the middle of an advanced placement geography exam when the Texas shooting occurred. “We’ve been busy with our lives. This will re-energize us. It has to.”  Some Parkland survivors directed frustration at politicians for not doing more. “Our children are being MURDERED and you’re treating this like a game,” student Jaclyn Corin wrote in response to President Donald Trump’s Twitter comments about the Texas shooting. “This is the 22nd school shooting just this year. DO SOMETHING.” Parkland senior Diego Pfeiffer, an organizer of the #NeverAgain movement, said his classmates wanted to keep the focus on the families most affected by the Texas shooting. “We came out of our experience wanting to tell our story,” he said in a text. “We are going to let them tell theirs.” Reporting by Zachary Fagenson; Additional reporting and writing by Joseph Ax in New York; Editing by Colleen Jenkins, Cynthia Osterman and Tom BrownOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","'DO SOMETHING,' Parkland survivors urge action after Texas school shooting",Y
2997768,467,['2018-05-21t02:31:00.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/world/americas/venezuela-election.html,"CARACAS, Venezuela ‚ President Nicol√°s Maduro won a second term as president of Venezuela, a country in the midst of a historic economic collapse marked by soaring prices, widespread hunger, rampant crime, a failing health system and a large-scale exodus of its citizens.Electoral officials declared Mr. Maduro the victor Sunday night, in a contest that critics said was heavily rigged in his favor.In the capital and around the country, the turnout was extremely low, with more than half of voters not casting ballots, reflecting both a call from many opposition leaders for a boycott of the vote and the disillusionment of longtime government supporters.Voting centers in pro-government strongholds and opposition areas alike often had no lines ‚ a significant change from previous presidential elections, and a sign that many Venezuelans repudiated the candidacies of both Mr. Maduro and the two opposition candidates. Election officials said Mr. Maduro, the political heir of Hugo Ch√°vez, the leftist firebrand who led this oil-rich country until his death in 2013, received 5.8 million votes, with more than 92 percent of voting centers reporting. That was nearly 68 percent of the votes cast.His main rival, Henri Falc√≥n, a former state governor who was once an acolyte of Mr. Ch√°vez‚s but broke with him to join the opposition, received 1.8 million votes. A third candidate, Javier Bertucci, a political novice and an evangelical minister, received 925,000. Mr. Maduro‚s current term continues until the end of the year; his new term will last six years. ‚So much they have underestimated the revolutionary people! So much they have underestimated me,‚ Mr. Maduro said, addressing a cheering outdoor crowd in Caracas. ‚And here we are again, victorious!‚He scarcely mentioned the low turnout and said that the 68 percent of the vote he received was the highest percentage for a winner in a Venezuelan presidential election, calling it a knockout. Despite his triumph, there is little relief in sight for Mr. Maduro or Venezuela.The United States ‚ which condemned the election as unfair and anti-democratic even before it happened ‚ has threatened stricter sanctions. Also likely to increase pressure on Mr. Maduro‚s government even before his next term begins: He has largely been cut off from international financing, and the government-run oil industry, which provides virtually all of the country‚s hard currency, is in free fall, with plummeting production.Some may also point to the low turnout and vote totals and question Mr. Maduro‚s leadership. He received about 1.5 million fewer votes than when he was first elected in 2013. Mr. Maduro has shown no signs so far that he has the ability to solve the country‚s deep problems, and his response to the crisis has often been to crack down harder on adversaries ‚ including the traditional opposition as well as rivals on his side of the political divide.The official turnout figure was given as 46 percent, compared to about 80 percent in the last two presidential elections.Mr. Falc√≥n accused Mr. Maduro‚s party of pressuring voters and said that he would not recognize the election results.‚We don‚t recognize this electoral process as valid,‚ Mr. Falc√≥n said, speaking at his campaign center before the official results were made public. ‚For us, there was no election. There must be a new election in Venezuela.‚ Mr. Falc√≥n had defied a broad call to boycott the election over expectations of just the sort of unfairness that he denounced after the polls closed. The United States and many countries in the region have said they would not recognize the results. Colombia and Brazil have received huge influxes of economic refugees from Venezuela.Mr. Maduro‚s victory was certain to set off a new round of infighting and finger pointing within the opposition. Some accused Mr. Falc√≥n of giving legitimacy to the president‚s re-election. Others asked if the opposition might have missed a chance to displace Mr. Maduro, given his falling popularity among his own supporters, many of whom failed to turn out.Venezuela, which is estimated to have the world‚s largest oil reserves, is in the throes of one of the worst economic crises in recent history in the Western Hemisphere. The International Monetary Fund estimates that inflation this year could reach 13,000 percent, by far the highest rate in the world.With soaring prices and shortages of basic goods of all kinds, many Venezuelans are malnourished. It is common to find families who eat just twice a day, and with little protein, fresh fruit or vegetables in those meals. Two pounds of chicken or beef costs as much as the monthly minimum wage package, which, including food coupons, is worth about $2.50.That is hardly a recipe for a president to win re-election, but Mr. Maduro sought to give himself every advantage in Sunday‚s vote.The electoral authorities banned the largest opposition political parties from taking part in the election, and key politicians were barred from running. Brutal repression of anti-government protests, and the arrests of many activists and leaders also weakened the opposition. Electoral authorities also moved up the election to May, although it is traditionally held in December, allowing little time for the opposition to organize and campaign. They even eliminated the requirement that voters dip a finger in indelible ink, which is used to keep people from voting more than once. In response, many opposition leaders called for an election boycott.Mr. Falc√≥n ultimately decided to break with the rest of the opposition and run against Mr. Maduro.Mr. Maduro attributes the country‚s problems to what he calls an economic war waged against Venezuela by the United States. But most economists place the blame on poor government management, corruption and broken policies, like tight controls over foreign exchange, an overvalued currency and price controls on goods.The government has responded to the crisis by providing people with boxes of food, including powdered milk and pasta, although most people say they arrive irregularly and do not contain nearly enough to sustain a household. The food boxes became both an incentive and a threat during the campaign, with many voters fearful that they could be cut off if they didn‚t support the government.At many polling places on Sunday, people cast their vote and then visited a so-called Red Spot ‚ named for the ruling Socialist Party‚s color ‚ set up nearby.At the Red Spot, voters presented the special identity card used to receive the food boxes and other services and gave their names to workers who were keeping lists of those who had voted. Workers at the Red Spots said that there was no effort to pressure voters or link a pro-Maduro vote to future food deliveries.Mr. Falc√≥n accused the government of violating campaign rules through the use of these Red Spots.A woman waiting outside a polling station in a Caracas slum, La Vega, said she worked for a government agency and feared losing her job if she did not vote and report afterward at the Red Spot. The woman, who would not give her name out of fear of reprisals, also said that she felt compelled to vote for Mr. Maduro, even though she did not support him, because she was sure that government computers tracked people‚s votes ‚ a common notion here. One of the most striking aspects of the day was the large number of voters who appeared to have stayed away.‚I‚m surprised by the low turnout,‚ said Loreima Henr√≠quez, a National Electoral Council employee, who was overseeing a polling place in Dos Caminos, a middle-class area of Caracas. There were about 4,200 voters registered to cast ballots there, but by 1 p.m. only 313 had done so.‚We were aware of the calls to abstain from voting, but many fewer people than we expected are coming out,‚ Ms. Henr√≠quez said.Rosa Rodr√≠guez, 50, a former Ch√°vez and Maduro supporter, said that this time she voted for Mr. Falc√≥n and volunteered to work as a poll watcher.‚People are not voting on both sides and I think this is a silent message that they‚re giving the country today,‚ said Ms. Rodriguez, who lives in a working-class area in the center of Caracas. ‚They have to realize that the people are protesting in silence. For me that says it all.‚In a slum abutting the main airport outside Caracas, Marielis Idimas, a mother of two, said she had voted for Mr. Maduro despite the economic hardships ‚ but she showed more resignation than enthusiasm. ‚My life is not good,‚ she said, sitting at a small stand where she sold eggs for 60,000 bol√≠vars each (the currency‚s devaluation makes that only about 6 cents although it is a vast sum for poor Venezuelans). ‚But who lives comfortably now?‚Another slum resident, Mar√≠a Garc√≠a, 63, said that she had not voted because doing so would have been supporting a sham.‚I‚m not going to be part of this,‚ Ms. Garc√≠a said. ‚I hate everything about this government and I don‚t want anything to do with them.‚",Venezuela Election Won by Maduro Amid Widespread Disillusionment,"May 23, 2018 /  6:29 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-election/venezuela-election-runner-up-to-formally-challenge-result-idUSKCN1IO2YM,"CARACAS (Reuters) - The runner-up in Venezuela’s election, which was widely condemned by other countries as undemocratic, will formally challenge his loss to President Nicolas Maduro after refusing to recognize the result, his campaign said on Wednesday. Ballots are counted on a table at a polling station during the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, May 20, 2018. REUTERS/Marco BelloThe head of Henri Falcon’s campaign, Claudio Fermin, told a news conference that given reports of hundreds of irregularities in Sunday’s voting, they would challenge the results before the national electoral board during the next 20 days. “There is a whole collection of irregularities,” Fermin said. Electoral board chief Tibisay Lucena, who is on individual U.S. and European Union sanctions lists, has already said Falcon’s allegations of voter fraud lacked evidence. The United States, European Union and most major Latin American nations have all said the election, which Maduro won easily, did not meet democratic standards. Venezuela’s mainstream opposition boycotted the election because two of its most popular leaders were barred, authorities had banned several political parties, and the election board is run by Maduro loyalists.  Maduro, the 55-year-old successor to late leftist leader Hugo Chavez, hailed his win, with 68 percent of the vote, as a victory against “imperialism.” Fermin said the government had failed to comply with the electoral board’s requirement that so-called “red points,” set up by Maduro’s government to register which Venezuelans receiving state aid had voted, be at least 200 meters from polling centers. Some red points were as close as 5 meters from voting centers, he said. Reuters witnesses on Sunday saw red points set up even inside some voting centers. Fermin also said in some voting centers Falcon’s observers were barred from entering and other centers stayed open later than 6 p.m., when they were required to close. Still, turnout was under 50 percent, well below the 80 percent reached in previous elections. In response to Maduro’s re-election, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday ramped up sanctions against OPEC member Venezuela, which is mired in an economic crisis that has led to shortages of basic goods. Maduro on Tuesday ordered the expulsion of two top U.S. diplomats in Caracas in retaliation. The expulsions would be “met with a swift response” from Washington, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday, although he gave no details.

3174224,478,['2018-05-20t14:13:57.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/world/asia/china-taiwan-island-south-sea.html,"ITU ABA, South China Sea ‚ The largest natural feature of the Spratly Islands, the hotly disputed archipelago in the South China Sea, is a forested, sun-drenched oval of land, cleaved by a single runway that gives the place the appearance of a raw coffee bean floating in bright blue water.Called Itu Aba, it is occupied not by China, which has aggressively asserted its territorial claims in the sea, but by its archrival, the self-governing democracy of Taiwan.The two broadly agree that there is a historical Chinese stake in the South China Sea, but they diverge radically over how to exercise stewardship over it. China has built artificial islands out of the reefs and shoals it controls and, according to analysts poring over satellite photographs, armed them with radars and missiles. Taiwan, by contrast, is soliciting competitive bids from companies to rebuild its small hospital here, bolstering sorely needed search and rescue facilities in the event of maritime disaster in the heavily trafficked sea.This ‚should become a center for humanitarian aid,‚ the director general of Taiwan‚s Coast Guard, Lee Chung-wei, explained during a recent visit to Itu Aba, a mere 110 acres in size.He was there, accompanied by other officials and a few journalists, to observe a training exercise involving a simulated collision of ships.‚In the case of a real collision, the disaster could be huge and would require a huge amount of medical energy to solve the problem,‚ Mr. Lee told reporters, ‚so we are trying to upgrade our capability as much as possible.‚ In Chinese, Itu Aba is known as Taiping, which means peaceful or tranquil, which happened to be the name of the warship that landed the first Chinese government official here in 1946. (More on that later.) Taiwanese sovereignty over the place, which is also claimed by the Philippines and Vietnam, is a matter of national pride. That pride, though, suffered a blow two years ago from which it is still struggling to recover.An international arbitration panel effectively rebuffed Taiwan‚s meticulously crafted argument that this was, in fact, an island under definitions set by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.The panel, adjudicating a claim brought by the Philippines against China‚s claims, declared it a ‚rock‚ instead, meaning it cannot sustain human habitation or economic activity. The demotion from being an ‚island‚ means that Taiwan can no longer claim exclusive economic control over a wide swath of waters around Itu Aba.It is, to be sure, a nice ‚rock.‚On either side of the runway, which was built in 2007 and expanded in 2012, dense growths include banana and coconut trees. Signs along the pathways warn of falling coconuts. The place is teeming with sea birds, and is a nesting ground for green sea turtles.China‚s man-made islands in the Spratly Islands, by contrast, are so new they lack significant vegetation. Itu Aba has four freshwater wells ‚ part of its claim to ‚island-ness‚ ‚ that provide water and nourish small plots that grow vegetables to feed the contingent of 150 to 200 people who live here, most of them from the Coast Guard.‚If Taiping Island is not deemed an island for the purposes of international law, then nothing down there is,‚ said Margaret K. Lewis, an American professor of law at Seton Hall University who is currently a senior Fulbright scholar in Taiwan. ‚It has the strongest claim to inhabit human life.‚The Spratly Islands, named after a British whaling captain who recorded them in 1843, comprise more than 100 ‚islands,‚ coral reefs and shoals that had no indigenous populations. They lie amid strategically important fisheries and shipping lanes ‚ and, possibly, reserves of oil and natural gas.They are claimed in their entirety by China, Taiwan and Vietnam, and in part by the Philippines, Malaysia and, most recently, Brunei.The excursion to Itu Aba ‚ a three-hour 20-minute flight from the southern tip of Taiwan ‚ was intended to showcase Taiwanese gentle sovereignty. Taiwan‚s role as a player in the disputes over the South China Sea has been largely overshadowed by China. And Taiwan‚s status seems precarious, if not yet directly threatened, despite maintaining its hold for more than seven decades on what was the largest above-water feature before China began its island-building spree in 2013.The same arbitration case that found Itu Aba to be a mere rock also rejected China‚s claims in the Spratly Islands, but China simply declared the arbitration panel‚s ruling moot. So did Taiwan, undercutting its own position that it seeks a peaceful resolution of the territorial disputes and a code of conduct that would govern activity in the waters.‚Taiwan has remained a marginal player in the dispute,‚ said Lynn Kuok of the International Institute for Strategic Studies-Asia in Singapore, who has written on Taiwan‚s policy in the South China Sea. ‚It has been unsuccessful in its attempts to be included in multilateral mechanisms aimed at managing or resolving disputes, such as the ongoing code of conduct negotiations.‚China makes every effort it can to weaken Taiwan‚s voice in international affairs generally, arguing that it is part of Chinese territory, though the Communist government in Beijing has never occupied the island.The claims to the Spratlys predate the civil war that ended with the Communist Party‚s triumph and the retreat of the Nationalist forces of the Republic of China to Taiwan in 1949. That, counterintuitively, bolsters China‚s claims today. The ‚nine-dash line‚ that China today uses to mark its territory was first on maps drafted in the 1940s by the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek. Despite claims of ancient historical links, Chinese officials in the first half of the 20th century were barely aware of the shoals and cays that make up the Spratlys until France annexed six of them, including Itu Aba, according to Bill Hayton, the author of ‚The South China Sea: The Struggle for Power in Asia.‚The Japanese seized them from the French in 1938, but then surrendered them after losing World War II. Concrete pilings extending off a white-sand beach ‚ the ruins of a submarine pier ‚ are a relic of Japan‚s brief rule.Two Chinese warships ‚ one called the Taiping ‚ visited Itu Aba in 1946, staking a claim that the Nationalist government held even after fleeing to Taiwan. The Nationalists did not regularly occupy the place until 1956. Beijing‚s presence in the Spratly islands came much later.China, which has steadily built up its military presence in the South China Sea, on Friday announced that it had for the first time landed bombers on another of its territories, Woody Island in the Paracels to the north, prompting a new rebuke from the Pentagon. Chen Yu-hsing, a senior executive officer with Taiwan‚s newly created Ocean Affairs Council, described a different vision for the waters. ‚We want this to be a peaceful place,‚ he said during the visit to Itu Aba.Indeed, this place has been less fiercely contested than others ‚ for example, the Scarborough Shoal, which has been the site of clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels. Lt. Chen Jin-min, a young Coast Guard officer, said that most of the activity he and his colleagues encountered in the surrounding waters involved Vietnamese fishermen. A small cay occupied by Vietnam is visible in the distance, roughly seven nautical miles away. Another controlled by China is 12 miles away.Lieutenant Chen has lived on Itu Aba for a year. While a tropical paradise, there is not much to do except swim or otherwise stay in shape. The housing is spare, but pleasant. There is a temple, a post office and, now, a 4G telephone network, provided by satellite.When asked what life was like in such a remote outpost, nearly 1,000 miles south of Taiwan, Lieutenant Chen replied simply, ‚pure.‚",Island or Rock?

U.S. Navy/Handout via Reuters/File Photo“A division of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) recently organized multiple bombers such as the H-6K to conduct take-off and landing training on islands and reefs in the South China Sea in order to improve our ability to ‘reach all territory, conduct strikes at any time and strike in all directions’,” it said in the statement issued on Friday. It said the pilot of the H-6K bomber conducted assault training on a designated sea target and then carried out take-offs and landings at an airport in the area, describing the exercise as preparation for “the West Pacific and the battle for the South China Sea”. The notice, published on the PLAAF’s Weibo microblogging account, did not provide the precise location of the exercise. The United States has dispatched warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China’s extensive sovereignty claims in the territory, which is subject to various claims by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia.  “The United States remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan told Reuters. “We have seen these same reports and China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilize the region.” Philippine opposition lawmakers condemned China’s militarization of the South China Sea and what they said was the inaction of their own government. Senator Risa Hontiveros sought an end to Manila’s “subservience” to China, while Congressman Gary Alejano said the issue of China’s militarization in the South China Sea is a “global concern”. “By placing our country within striking distance of its nuclear-capable bombers, China has virtually threatened us with nuclear war over the West Philippine Sea,” Hontiveros said in a statement, using the local name for South China Sea. “With the silence and subservience of the Philippine government to China, we are placing in grave danger not only our country, but also our neighboring nations,” Alejano said in a statement. China says its military facilities in the Spratlys are purely defensive, and that it can do what it likes on its own territory. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte defended his position not to confront China and reiterated his openness to undertake joint exploration and development in waters believed to be rich in oil and natural gas. “You know they have the planes, not stationed in Spratlys but near the provinces facing — Chinese provinces facing the Spratlys and the China Sea,” he said in a speech late on Saturday. It was not clear if he was aware of the news about China’s bombers landing on islands and reefs in the South China Sea.   “And with their hypersonic, they can reach Manila within 7 to 10 minutes. If we will go to a full-blown war, where would the Philippines end up?” Duterte said.

Even after Chelsea won the game at Wembley Stadium in London 1-0, Roman Abramovich was nowhere to be seen.A person close to the Russian oligarch said that his investor visa ‚ initially valid for three years and four months and normally extended with ease after that every two years ‚ expired at the end of April and that an application to renew it was taking far longer than usual. The British authorities have given no explanation, the person said.This has fueled speculation that the British authorities may be pulling the welcome mat for wealthy, Kremlin-connected Russians like Mr. Abramovich who have made London their second home.The British Home Office, the government department responsible for immigration issues, has not publicly commented on why it was taking so long. The security minister, Ben Wallace, said in an email on Sunday, ‚We do not routinely comment on individual cases.‚ Diplomatic relations between London and Moscow sank to their lowest level in decades after a nerve agent attack in March on a retired Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, in the English cathedral town of Salisbury. The two have been released from the hospital and are recovering.Prime Minister Theresa May  blamed Moscow for the brazen attack on British soil, expelled 23 Russian diplomats and rallied Western allies to condemn Russia. Moscow has steadfastly denied any involvement.Mrs. May  also vowed to ‚freeze Russian state assets wherever we have the evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of U.K. nationals or residents.‚ She said, ‚There is no place for these people ‚ or their money ‚ in our country.‚But Downing Street had appeared to have stepped back from its threats to take broad action against wealthy Russians‚ assets and against those oligarchs who benefit from their ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To secure an extension, holders of so-called Tier-1 investor visas issued before 2014 normally need only show that they have $1.35 million under their control in Britain and have invested three-quarters of that amount in British government bonds, shares or in loans to British companies. With a net worth estimated at more than $10 billion, hundreds of millions of which have been invested in Britain, Mr. Abramovich should have no trouble clearing that hurdle. He owns a huge house in London that is worth more than $150 million and is equipped with a subterranean swimming pool.In April, the United States Treasury announced that it was imposing sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including several with extensive ties to Britain like Oleg Deripaska, who in November listed his aluminum and energy conglomerate, EN+, on the London stock exchange. But Mr. Abramovich was not among those targeted by the United States.If Mr. Abramovich‚s British visa delay turns out to be more than a bureaucratic hiccup, it could be a sign that the British government, too, is moving against Russian oligarchs and wants to curb what has been called ‚Londongrad,‚ a large community of Russians, both fans and foes of Mr. Putin, who have sought shelter in the British capital for their money and families.Perhaps anticipating trouble in Britain, Mr. Abramovich, according to Swiss news media reports in February, applied for residency in Switzerland but withdrew his application last year after a cool response from the federal authorities in Bern.Mr. Abramovich, in contrast to some other Russian tycoons, has avoided dabbling publicly in British politics. But his ownership of Chelsea has made him a staple of celebrity and sports coverage in tabloid and serious British newspapers, and he is by far the best-known Russian oligarch in Britain. Chelsea fans hail him as a hero because his hefty investment in buying top-class players has turned the team into a soccer powerhouse.He has also won good will by donating more than $300 million to a British charity that provides holidays abroad for children with serious illnesses and by hosting lavish, A-list parties on his yacht, the world‚s second biggest, and at his mansion in the British Virgin Islands. Russians who have fallen out with the Kremlin, and British analysts who take a dim view of Mr. Putin, view him as a Kremlin lackey. His businesses in Russia, which include oil and other interests, have escaped unscathed under Mr. Putin while those of other tycoons critical of the Kremlin, like Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Boris Berezovsky, have been ransacked by the state.The delay in renewing his visa comes at a delicate time for Mr. Abramovich, who has been struggling in recent weeks to defend his name in Switzerland over $46 million that the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development insists is owed by the oligarch‚s now-defunct, Swiss-based oil trading company, Runicom.The dispute, which dates to the end of the 1990s, resurfaced recently when a court in Freiburg, Switzerland, began hearing testimony, including from Mr. Abramovich, who first made his money as an oil trader and then gained control of former state oil fields with help from Boris Berezovsky, a onetime Kremlin ally and tycoon who, after falling out with Mr. Putin, fled to Britain and died there in 2013.","U.K. Visa for Roman Abramovich, Russian Billionaire, Is Delayed","May 21, 2018 /  11:11 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-abramovich/uk-pm-mays-spokesman-says-cannot-comment-on-russian-billionaires-abramovich-visa-delay-idUSKCN1IM10W,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said on Monday the government could not comment on why Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich’s visa was yet to be renewed.

2975814,466,['2018-05-20t21:22:24.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/world/middleeast/iraq-election-sadr.html,"BAGHDAD ‚ Iraqis are still haunted by memories of black-clad death squads roaming Baghdad neighborhoods a decade ago, cleansing them of Sunnis as the country was convulsed by sectarian violence.Many of the mass killings in the capital were done in the name of Moktada al-Sadr, a cleric best remembered by Americans for fiery sermons declaring it a holy duty among his Shiite faithful to attack United States forces.The militia he led was armed with Iranian-supplied weapons, and Mr. Sadr cultivated a strong alliance with leaders in Tehran, who were eager to supplant the American presence in Iraq and play the dominant role in shaping the country‚s future.Now, the man once demonized by the United States as one of the greatest threats to peace and stability in Iraq has come out as the surprise winner of this month‚s tight elections, after a startling reinvention into a populist, anticorruption campaigner whose ‚Iraq First‚ message appealed to voters across sectarian divides. The results have   Washington ‚ and Tehran ‚ on edge, as officials in both countries seek to influence what is expected to be a complex and drawn-out battle behind the scenes to build a coalition government. Mr. Sadr‚s bloc won 54 seats ‚ the most of any group, but still far short of a majority in Iraq‚s 329-seat Parliament.Even before final results were announced early Saturday, Mr. Sadr ‚ who did not run as a candidate and has ruled himself out as prime minister ‚ had made clear whom he considers natural political allies. At the top of his list is Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, the moderate Shiite leader who has been America‚s partner in the fight against the Islamic State and whose political bloc finished third in the vote.Pointedly absent from Mr. Sadr‚s list of potential partners: pro-Iranian blocs, as he has insistently distanced himself from his former patrons in Iran, whose meddling he has come to see as a destabilizing force in Iraq‚s politics. Early Sunday morning, the prime minister met with Mr. Sadr in Baghdad. They discussed forming a government, and aides from both sides said the men saw eye to eye on prioritizing the fight against corruption. While Mr. Sadr has all the momentum going into negotiations over the governing coalition, there is no guarantee his bloc will be in power. And it is too early to tell what the election may mean for Iraqi stability or American national security goals.But the upset has clearly weakened the sectarian foundation of Iraq‚s political system ‚ and helped transform Mr. Sadr‚s image from the paragon of a militant Shiite into an unexpected symbol of reform and Iraqi nationalism.As the head of the Sairoon Alliance for Reform, Mr. Sadr presides over an unlikely alliance that pairs his pious, largely working-class Shiite base with Sunni business leaders, liberals and Iraqis looking for relief from the country‚s long-simmering economic crisis.For those joining the alliance, it was important to be convinced that Mr. Sadr‚s shift from Shiite firebrand to Iraqi patriot was sincere, and likely to last.Late last year, the cleric began reaching out to groups outside his base with an offer to form a new political movement, and the country‚s embattled leftists and secularists ‚ once his staunch enemies ‚ faced a moment of reckoning.They remembered how a rogue Shariah court he had established passed sentences on fellow Shiites deemed too submissive toward the American occupation of Iraq. And they recalled the countless Iraqis killed in battles between the country‚s security forces and Mr. Sadr‚s militia. But a ragtag group of communists, social democrats and anarchists have come to embrace Mr. Sadr as a symbol of the reform they have championed for years ‚ an image that the cleric has burnished, seeing it as the best path to political power. ‚Let me be honest: We had a lot of apprehensions, a lot of suspicions,‚ said Raad Fahmi, a leader of Iraq‚s Communist Party, which is part of Mr. Sadr‚s alliance. ‚But actions speak louder than words. He‚s not the same Moktada al-Sadr.‚ISIS Changes EverythingThe change in Mr. Sadr was prompted by the political and security crisis set off by the Islamic State‚s takeover of large parts of northern and western Iraq in 2014, according to Sheikh Saleh al-Obeidi, Mr. Sadr‚s spokesman. The ensuing violence led to an overwhelming shift in the public mood: a feeling that sectarianism was at the root of much of the country‚s suffering.Mr. Sadr, the scion of an eminent clerical family, has portrayed his changed political philosophy in starkly pragmatic terms.In his only extensive interview before the elections, given to his own television channel, Mr. Sadr put forth a manifesto largely adopted from his new secularist allies. He said his goals were to put professionals ‚ not partisan loyalists ‚ into positions of power as a way to build national institutions that serve the people instead of political insiders.‚We have tried the Islamists and they failed terribly,‚ Mr. Sadr said, a rebuke that his aides said included his own movement. ‚So let us try another way in which the independent technocrat or independent Islamist or secular technocrat, whoever is best for the job, takes over a ministry and makes it productive. We should try that.‚Whether Mr. Sadr can succeed with his reform agenda is an open question, said Joost Hiltermann, the director of the International Crisis Group‚s Middle East program, as building a majority coalition will mean partnering with some of the established faces that voters expressed dissatisfaction with at the polls. Those other politicians ‚have much to lose from an effort to curb corruption,‚ Mr. Hiltermann said. In addition to this new domestic philosophy, Mr. Sadr, 45, has honed an ‚Iraq First‚ foreign policy.He has expanded his once singular anti-American focus to include diatribes against Iran. He also has built bridges with close American allies in the Arab world, like Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.The Mr. Sadr of today, his aides say, is remarkably different from the one President George W. Bush called America‚s greatest enemy in Iraq, on a par with Al Qaeda.Diplomats from several Western countries, including ones whose coalition troops were killed by Mr. Sadr‚s militia, have met with him and say they are looking for ways to work with the newly influential leader. They are ready to draw the curtain on past events, they said, in hopes of finding common ground over containing Iran‚s influence in Iraq.But many Iraqis are not convinced his that new stance is here to stay.Among them are several senior commanders in the Iraqi security forces who are trying to build a centralized chain of command at the expense of sectarian militias. Those militias have enhanced their standing because of their role in helping defeat the Islamic State, but continue to have a reputation for lawlessness.In the week since the election, several senior political rivals of Sairoon have privately criticized Mr. Sadr, citing his militia‚s long record of violence. None would speak publicly, however, given the delicate political jockeying underway to build a coalition government. The broader Sunni population remains wary of Mr. Sadr. But many Sunnis did give their vote to Mr. Abadi‚s bloc, so a governing coalition that includes both sides would represent a significant bridging of the country‚s sectarian divide. Shifting RolesThe first time many Iraqis heard the name Moktada al-Sadr was soon after the Americans seized control of Baghdad in 2003. In the post-occupation chaos, Mr. Sadr emerged as a type of Robin Hood, deploying his recently formed militia to distribute food to the poor and defend Shiites against what many came to view as acts of American aggression.Amid this ferment, a leading Iraqi cleric, Abdel Majid al-Khoei, was killed in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, shocking millions of followers. Many within the Shiite clerical orders believed Mr. Sadr had ordered the killing to settle an old family feud.The Americans secured an arrest warrant for Mr. Sadr, but found no one in the new Shiite political leadership willing to support his detention, according to Iraqi and American officials. Mr. Sadr has denied any wrongdoing.American officials came to believe that their reluctance to confront Mr. Sadr reflected a tacit acceptance of the sectarian warfare waged by his militia against Iraqi Sunnis.Over time, respect for Mr. Sadr‚s militia among many Iraqis turned to revulsion. Units became known for Mafia-style protection rackets, kidnappings and extortion, even in Shiite neighborhoods. A growing backlash prompted Mr. Sadr to leave for Iran in 2007. In 2008, while Mr. Sadr was still in Iran, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki took decisive action. He ordered the Iraqi army to the city of Basra to stem militia violence there. An intense urban battle killed 215 militia members and wounded 600.The blow sidelined Mr. Sadr for a time. He ordered his militia into hibernation, but pointedly never had his men disarm. By 2012, Mr. Sadr, who had returned from Iran, had regained enough influence to spearhead a vote of no-confidence against Mr. Maliki, a maneuver that spun Iraq into a new crisis.Odd BedfellowsThen in 2014, another national crisis erupted: a security collapse as the Islamic State took over one-third of the country.Mr. Sadr called his militia back to the front lines, but this time as a partner of the diverse Iraqi security forces and the American-led coalition fighting the extremists.He also turned his attention to a small protest movement organized by leftists and secularists in the capital. The demonstrations in Tahrir Square in Baghdad were on behalf of civil servants and pensioners, and against growing economic inequality and the lack of essentials like electricity and health care. The protesters were mostly ignored by Iraq‚s political establishment, but Mr. Sadr viewed their demands as an echo of the plaintive calls of his own base for better jobs and government services. So he looked to build relationships with these groups, despite their diametrically different worldviews.Mr. Sadr‚s closest aide, Dhia‚a Assadi, called the overtures sincere and logical. ‚His eminence has always been a voice for the poor,‚ Mr. Assadi said. ‚He saw that it was to the benefit for all Iraqis for those who share principles to come together.‚For the past two years, supporters of Mr. Sadr have banded together with communists, intellectuals and community activists in protest rallies, efforts that have built mutual respect.Last fall, the Communist Party leadership visited Mr. Sadr at his headquarters in Najaf, the home of Iraq‚s clerical establishment. Mr. Fahmi, one of the Communist leaders, said several of his comrades were initially cool to the idea of joining forces with someone perceived to have so much blood on his hands.In the end, most members accepted that if radical political change was going to work in Iraq, it needed a popular leader to bring the masses on board.‚So what if Moktada al-Sadr is now the face of reform?‚ Mr. Fahmi said. ‚What should I care as long as the reforms happen? He‚s a man who can motivate millions.‚‚If our society improves because of him,‚ he added, ‚I‚ll be the first one to congratulate him.‚","Once Hated by U.S. and Tied to Iran, Is Sadr Now ‚ÄòFace of Reform‚Äô in Iraq?","May 22, 2018 /  6:00 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-election-sadr/u-s-in-contact-with-iraqi-ex-foe-sadr-after-his-surprise-election-win-sadr-aide-idUSKCN1IN2KO,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The United States has contacted members of a political bloc in Iraq led by a former foe, the Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, after his election win put him in a strong position to influence the formation of a new government, a top Sadr aide said.

REUTERS/Alaa al-Marjani/File PhotoThe surprise victory by Sadr’s political alliance Sairoon in a  parliamentary election last week has put Washington into an awkward position. His Mehdi Army militia fought violent battles against U.S. troops after Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003. Despite their past enmity, Washington and Sadr, an Iraqi nationalist, agree on their opposition to Iran’s deep influence in Iraq, where it arms, trains and funds Shi’ite militias and nurtures close ties with many politicians. Dhiaa al-Asadi, a top aide to the cleric, said U.S. officials had used intermediaries to initiate contact with members of his Sairoon alliance.  “They asked what the position of the Sadrist movement will be when they come to power. Are they going to reinvent or invoke the Mahdi Army or reemploy them? Are they going to attack American forces in Iraq,” he told Reuters. But according to Asadi there was no question of another Mahdi Army, which Sadr said he disbanded in 2008.  “There’s no return to square one. We are not intending on having any military force other than the official military force, police forces and security forces,” Asadi said.  Sadr cannot be prime minister himself since he did not run in the election, but has been meeting the leaders of other blocs and setting conditions on his support for candidates for prime minister. He says he wants someone who rejects sectarianism, foreign interference and corruption in Iraq.  Sairoon’s success could turn out to be a setback for Tehran and a boon for the United States, which seems happy to forget its past gripes with Sadr.       “We remain open to meet and work with the government that is formed and given that Sairoon won the plurality of seats and they’ll certainly make up a part of this government,” said a U.S. official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity. “The U.S. is eager and willing to meet with a variety of people who will be involved in the government and Sadr will be a player in that.” The United States is believed to have some 7,000 troops in Iraq now, though the Pentagon has only acknowledged 5,200 troops. They are mostly training and advising Iraqi forces. Sadr, long seen by Iraqi and U.S. officials as an unpredictable maverick, made his surprise comeback by tapping popular resentment towards Iran and anger the Tehran-backed political elite in Baghdad which some voters say is corrupt. “His political views seem to vary, to put it kindly,” said another U.S. official involved in the effort to understand what Sadr is doing. “At this point, we don’t know what he really wants.” IRAN UNDER U.S. PRESSURE Sadr’s re-ascendance in Baghdad will worry Iran especially as it grapples with U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out from Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers and to reimpose sanctions.  Tehran has skillfully manipulated Iraqi politics in its favour in the past, and may try to undermine Sadr’ attempts to shape a new government.  Just days after election results were announced, Qassem Soleimani, head of the foreign operations branch of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, arrived in Baghdad to meet politicians. An Iraqi former senior official said Sadr would try to outfox Iran, but added that he believed Tehran would not tolerate any threats to its allies in Iraq. “There are limits on how far he can go. At the end they (the Iranians) can control him. They give him a lot of room to manoeuvre ... but eventually, when he challenges the Shi’ites and their interests, I think they will be very tough. They (the Iranians) have very many tools to undermine him.”  Sairoon has not ruled out forming a coalition with the bloc headed by Iran’s strongest ally in Iraq, paramilitary leader Hadi al-Amiri, as long as he abandons what Asadi says are sectarian policies and becomes an Iraqi nationalist. “We did not have an official meeting with them (the Iranians). Sometimes we receive some calls that are related to what’s going on. But this cannot be considered a meeting or a discussion over any issue,” said Asadi. The election dealt a blow to incumbent Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whose Victory Alliance came in third. But Western diplomats and analysts say Abadi, a British-educated engineer, still has cards to play. He could emerge as a compromise candidate - palatable to all sides because he managed the competing interests of the United States and Iran - inadvertent allies in the war against Islamic State - during his term in office. “As of yet, no one has yet emerged as an alternative, not in a serious way,” said Ali al-Mawlawi, head of research at Baghdad-based Al-Bayan think-tank.

But he had stayed in some kind of touch with a group of business associates, art world experts and friends until recent years, when they said their efforts to visit, their phone calls and their emails, went unanswered or were rebuffed by the man who cared for Mr. Indiana. He said the artist was too ill to deal with them. One friend, John Wilmerding, emeritus professor of American art at Princeton University, questioned why an ‚impenetrable wall‚ had been put up. ‚Not just to me, but to all of his old friends,‚ he said.[Read the New York Times obituary of Robert Indiana.]In a federal lawsuit filed Friday, a day before Mr. Indiana‚s death at 89, a company that says it has long held the rights to several of Mr. Indiana‚s best-known works proposed an answer, arguing in court papers that the caretaker and a New York art publisher had tucked the artist away while they churned out unauthorized or adulterated versions of his work.‚They have isolated Indiana from his friends and supporters, forged some of Indiana‚s most recognizable works, exhibited the fraudulent works in museums, and sold the fraudulent works to unsuspecting collectors,‚ said the lawsuit filed last week by Morgan Art Foundation Ltd. in Federal District Court in Manhattan.Among the works cited in the suit were a series of silk-screen prints that feature the lyrics of Bob Dylan, said to have been created in 2016 by Mr. Indiana and recently exhibited at several galleries and museums including the Bates College Museum of Art.The New York art publisher, Michael McKenzie, said in an interview Friday that Mr. Indiana had conceived and authorized all the recent art that bears his name and that his caretaker, Jamie L. Thomas, had only been following the artist‚s orders in limiting visitors. ‚Bob does not want to see anybody,‚ Mr. McKenzie said last week. ‚He just feels, like, ‚I am old, I need to eat a lot of soup. I am trying to keep it together.‚‚ Mr. McKenzie accused the Morgan company of falsely suggesting it represents Mr. Indiana and of voiding any agreement with him by failing to make required royalty payments, both charges that the company denied.With Mr. Indiana‚s death, the dispute is likely to broaden now into questions of who controls Mr. Indiana‚s legacy and estate. Mr. Indiana never married, and he has few close relatives. Luke Nikas, the lawyer for Morgan Art Foundation, said that, as of 2016, the artist‚s will had called for his works and house to be transferred to a foundation to be overseen by a New York lawyer, Ronald D. Spencer.But Mr. Spencer was let go in 2016, he said, and Mr. Indiana that same year gave his power of attorney to Mr. Thomas, which gave him the authority to make decisions. Mr. McKenzie said the transfer of control to Mr. Thomas was part of an effort by Mr. Indiana to enlist help in battling Morgan and that Mr. Thomas had been carefully managing Mr. Indiana‚s legacy through a vehicle called the Star of Hope Foundation.Mr. McKenzie, whose art publishing business, American Image Art, lists a number of important artists as clients, said his relationship with Mr. Indiana goes back to the 1970s. In the 1990s he published two books that contained Indiana imagery. In 2008, he helped to promote Mr. Indiana‚s ‚HOPE‚ image, which the artist created to support the Obama campaign. But within New York art circles, it was Morgan Art Foundation and the company‚s adviser, Simon Salama-Caro, who were better known as the representatives of Mr. Indiana.The Morgan company says it has served as Mr. Indiana‚s agent since the 1990s, when Mr. Salama-Caro sought out the largely forgotten artist who had shut himself away on this island. He struck an agreement with Mr. Indiana under which, in exchange for royalties, the artist authorized Morgan to produce and sell limited editions of some of Mr. Indiana‚s most celebrated works, including ‚LOVE.‚The company and Mr. Salama-Caro were later credited with helping to fuel a comeback for Mr. Indiana, whose profile rose with gallery shows and a major retrospective in 2013 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Mr. Salama-Caro, who earns commissions on the sales, and his family have also started assembling a full catalog of Mr. Indiana‚s work.The lawsuit contends that the company‚s rights have been violated by some of the new work and that the artist‚s legacy and market values are threatened by what is described as its inauthenticity and proliferation. The lawsuit named Mr. Indiana as a defendant because he was party to the agreement that Morgan argues has been violated.Mr. Salama-Caro said that among the troubling recent pieces was ‚WINE,‚ a sculpture that mimics the monumental imagery of ‚LOVE.‚ The magazine Wine Enthusiast featured the sculpture on its May cover and published an interview with Mr. Indiana, conducted by email, in which he described his long affection for wine and said he had created another work using malbec as a stain.Barbara Haskell, who curated the Whitney‚s Indiana retrospective, said she was surprised that Mr. Indiana had created a ‚WINE‚ sculpture. ‚Whatever four-letter words he used, they were always psychologically charged,‚ she said. What‚s more, Professor Wilmerding and several other friends said they had not known Mr. Indiana to be a wine drinker. Mr. McKenzie said that Mr. Indiana had indeed been a lover of wine and that it was offensive to suggest the artist was not entitled to explore new directions.ImageThe sculpture ‚WINE,‚ credited to Mr. Indiana, was featured on a magazine cover and accompanied by an interview. Mr. Salama-Caro said it was among the recent pieces that troubled him.Mr. Indiana‚s move to Vinalhaven came at a time when he was embittered by rampant copying, declining prices and a lack of appreciation of his other art beyond ‚LOVE.‚If it was Mr. Indiana‚s intention to vanish, it‚s difficult to completely disappear on Vinalhaven, a place of granite quarries and lobster boats, whose 1,200 year-round residents know each other at a level familiar to anyone who has lived in a small town. And Mr. Indiana lived in perhaps the island‚s most remarkable building, a former chapter headquarters of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows on Main Street that is a landmark and has its own name, the Star of Hope.He used to open the house for tours, residents say, and eat breakfast down the road at a diner on the dock. But sightings of him had been rare in recent years, and those who have been able to visit him say that he had grown gaunt and spoken of health problems.The chief caretaker, Mr. Thomas, 53, who once operated a seafood business on the island, had served as Mr. Indiana‚s studio assistant for several years. He did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Mr. Thomas is the gatekeeper who people like Professor Wilmerding complain had made it difficult to speak to Mr. Indiana. Paul Kasmin, a New York gallerist who has represented Mr. Indiana‚s works for more than a decade, said he had not seen Mr. Indiana for about five years and had given up sending postcards, emails and gifts to Vinalhaven in an effort to reach him.Kathleen Rogers, who had worked for a time as Mr. Indiana‚s publicist, said that she had been a frequent visitor to his home until 2015 when she said she began to be repeatedly rebuffed by Mr. Thomas. She became so concerned about the artist‚s isolation that in February she said she made a report to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, asking it to review Mr. Indiana‚s situation.‚I feared for him,‚ she said. ‚Everybody in his inner circle was discussing the fact that they had not seen him.‚A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment.In 2014, Mr. Salama-Caro‚s son, Marc, surreptitiously filmed Mr. Indiana during a rare visit to his home and asked the artist about Mr. McKenzie and the proliferation of new works carrying his name.‚Help me,‚ Mr. Indiana says on the video clip. ‚How does one restrain Michael? He‚s beyond me. He‚s mischievous.‚ Mr. McKenzie said Mr. Indiana was just making the point that Mr. McKenzie was always bombarding him with new ideas. Dan Mills, director of the Bates museum, said the museum‚s 2016 Indiana show was arranged through Mr. McKenzie, who had helped organize the show‚s tour in conjunction with Landau Traveling Exhibitions. He said he did not speak with Mr. Indiana during that time but later traveled to Vinalhaven to see the artist and was told he was not available.Professor Wilmerding traveled to Bates, in Lewiston, Me., to tour the Indiana exhibit and said it felt odd, like being in a ‚twilight zone.‚ He recognized many of the older works, he said, but found some of the newer ones unsettling.‚It is Bob‚s vocabulary,‚ he said, ‚but I wonder if it is his voice.‚",Robert Indiana Had All but Vanished in Recent Years. Some Friends Wondered Why.,"May 18, 2018 /  9:02 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-art-robertindiana-lawsuit/legacy-of-love-artist-robert-indiana-is-subject-of-new-lawsuit-idUSKCN1IJ2Q9,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The legacy and works of American pop artist Robert Indiana, best known for his iconic “Love” image, are the focus of a lawsuit filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court. A young couple has their photo taken in front of Robert Indiana's iconic LOVE sculpture in Philadelphia, February 12, 2015.   REUTERS/Charles Mostoller Morgan Art Foundation, which said it has been Indiana’s agent for more than two decades, accused American Image Art and others of exploiting the now “bedridden and infirm” artist, by forging some of his famous works and selling them for millions of dollars to unsuspecting collectors. Indiana, who turns 90 in September, is best known for his image of the letters L, O, V and E arranged in a square, with the O tilted diagonally to the right. He created it in 1965 for a Christmas card by the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. The image appeared on a U.S. postage stamp in 1973. Morgan Art Foundation said Indiana has become isolated since giving Jamie Thomas, whom he had allegedly employed to run errands and do work around his Maine home, power of attorney two years ago, enabling American Image Art and its founder Michael McKenzie to profit at the artist’s expense. “We filed this action to protect Robert Indiana and his legacy,” Luke Nikas, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing the plaintiff, said in a phone interview. The complaint seeks a variety of damages for trademark infringement, breach of contract and other claims for what Nikas called a “rogue and brazenly unlawful” forgery scheme. McKenzie, who had yet to see the 53-page complaint, in a separate phone interview rejected Morgan’s contentions. “I feel badly for Robert Indiana. This is one of the most important living artists, on the order of (Andy) Warhol and (Roy) Lichtenstein,” he said. “I’m sure the countersuit will be interesting.” McKenzie also said Indiana’s health is better than the plaintiff described. “Bob is quite sharp,” he said. “There are times when he’s off, which is expected, but there are times he is as sharp as he’s ever been. His ability to understand what’s what and why, and make good decisions - he’s clear about what he wants and doesn’t want.” Thomas’ lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Indiana is also a defendant, after having provided the alleged power of attorney enabling the creation and sale by other defendants of infringing works. Morgan said it had been reluctant to sue, and believes Indiana would not have voluntarily allowed Thomas to conduct the alleged activities on his behalf.      Indiana could not immediately be reached for comment. The case is Morgan Art Foundation Ltd v McKenzie et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-04438.

Fox submitted its current bid for Sky in December 2016, but the company has faced a series of regulatory roadblocks since then. Mr. Hancock is still considering that bid and is expected to make a final decision about it by sometime in June.Comcast said in a statement that it welcomed Mr. Hancock‚s position and remained ‚focused on progressing our superior offer for Sky.‚ Comcast and Fox are in something of a bidding war for the satellite broadcaster. Under the terms of its offer, Comcast would pay 12.50 pounds, or about $16.83, in cash for each Sky share. Fox has offered ¬£10.75 a share. Sky had originally supported the Fox bid, but in April withdrew that recommendation after the Comcast proposal was submitted.The competing offers by Fox and Comcast highlight the appeal of Sky, which has 23 million subscribers spread across multiple European countries, owns lucrative rights to broadcast English Premier League soccer games and other professional sports matches and has an online streaming service.For Comcast, the Sky bid offers another benefit: It complicates Fox‚s plan to sell most of its businesses to the Walt Disney Company for $52.4 billion.Mr. Murdoch founded Sky in 1989, and he has long sought to regain control of it. He abandoned an earlier effort to buy the 61 percent of the company he does not already own after 21st Century Fox‚s predecessor company was caught up in a scandal over phone-hacking by British news outlets.Mr. Murdoch, a powerful but divisive figure in Britain, owns the right-of-center newspaper The Times, and The Sun, a right-wing tabloid. In January, Britain‚s competition regulator said a takeover of Sky and its 24-hour satellite channel, Sky News, would give him too much control over the British media. Comcast said as part of its bid that it was committed to Sky News‚s editorial independence, and the American cable company has pledged to set up a board for the channel and maintain its financing. Comcast has also pledged to increase its investment in Britain‚s film and television industries.Sky, in a statement, acknowledged Mr. Hancock‚s statement but did not offer any further details. The company‚s shares rose 0.5 percent, to ¬£13.62, in afternoon trading in London.","U.K. Unlikely to Block Comcast‚Äôs Proposed Sky Takeover, Minister Says","June 5, 2018 /  1:14 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/fox-ma-sky-britain/britain-clears-fox-bid-for-sky-if-it-sells-sky-news-idUSL9N1R1026,"LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Britain cleared Rupert Murdoch’s bid to buy Sky on Tuesday so long as Sky News is sold, paving the way for the mogul’s Twenty-First Century Fox to go head-to-head with rival Comcast Corp for the European pay-TV group.

3647710,546,['2018-05-21t21:40:56.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/pele-hawaii-volcano.html,"PAHOA, Hawaii ‚ When the rivers of lava forced thousands to flee this month, many people on Hawaii‚s Big Island pointed with awe toward the drizzle-shrouded volcanic crater where Pele ‚ known as ‚the woman who devours the earth‚ ‚ usually dwells.‚Our deity is coming down to play,‚ said Lokelani Puha, 52, a hula dancer and poet who evacuated as the lava encroached, referring to Hawaii‚s goddess of volcanoes and fire. ‚There‚s nothing to do when Pele makes up her mind but accept her will.‚Hawaiians have endured the overthrow of their kingdom, annexation by the United States and policies aimed at obliterating the Hawaiian language. But in a striking display of the resilience and adaptability of Native Hawaiian culture, the exaltation of Pele has not only persisted through the centuries, but seems to be strengthening with every bone-rattling eruption of Hawaii‚s volcanoes.The Kilauea volcano has already laid waste to dozens of homes this month, triggering earthquakes, releasing lethal gases and setting forests ablaze, and on Monday it showed few signs of subsiding. A lava stream over the weekend blocked a highway that people have been using as an escape route. It reached the ocean to produce a caustic plume of acid fumes laced with fine volcanic glass specks. On Monday, a new flow began moving toward a geothermal plant, raising fears over the potential release of volcanic gases from wells on the site. Flying lava shattered a man‚s leg while he was on the third-floor balcony of his home on rural Noni Farms Road. And yet many living in Kilauea‚s shadow welcome the eruption, express reverence for Pele and thank her ‚ even when the lava destroys their home.‚My house was an offering for Pele,‚ said Monica Devlin, 71, a retired schoolteacher whose home was destroyed by a lava flow. ‚I‚ve been in her backyard for 30 years,‚ she reflected, doing the math on when she moved here from Northern California. ‚In that time I learned that Pele created this island in all its stunning beauty. It‚s an awe-inspiring process of destruction and creation and I was lucky to glimpse it.‚In a state where ethnic tension sometimes simmers beneath a veneer of tranquillity, proclaiming veneration for Pele is something uniting many Native Hawaiians and outsiders, though their methods for doing so often vary. Scholars of Hawaiian culture point out that the honorific name for Pele (pronounced PEH-leh) is Pelehonuamea, incorporating the deity‚s sacred connection to the earth, the oceans and the red color of lava. Many Hawaiians call the goddess Madame Pele or Tutu Pele, using an affectionate term for grandmother while making it implicitly clear they are Pele‚s descendants.Legends vary as to her origins, but chants suggest Pele followed her star to Hawaii from elsewhere in Polynesia, similar to the seafarers who reached the Hawaiian Islands in an epic feat of navigation and migration around the time Europe was mired in the Dark Ages.Some say Pele was born in Tahiti to the fertility goddess Haumea, but was forced to flee to Hawaii in a great canoe after seducing the husband of her older sister, the goddess of the sea. At different islands in Hawaii, Pele used her stick to dig out fire pits, forging the archipelago‚s magnificent volcanic craters.After the United States formally took control of Hawaii in 1898, appeasing Pele and accepting her force didn‚t seem to be much of an official priority. Before rising to prominence as a general during World War II, George S. Patton, then the Army‚s chief intelligence officer in Hawaii, tried bombing the lava flow from the eruption of the Mauna Loa volcano in 1935 in an attempt to divert it.While that tactic had mixed results, some on the Big Island put their faith in making offerings to Pele of items including crystals, money and incense, or foods such as whole cooked piglet and poi, a staple made from the taro plant. Many venture near fissures to place the leaves of the ti plant, also called the palm lily, in the cracks in the earth.‚We believe in 40,000 gods, but Pele is in the highest echelon for obvious reasons,‚ said Kimo Awai, 67, a hula teacher and lecturer on Hawaiian culture. ‚Pele created Hawaii; she is that primordial force that exists within all land masses. And she can be vengeful, so watch out.‚ In Pahoa, a counterculture outpost where ganja smoke wafts through the air, a lava flow in 2014 threatened the town, but in the end destroyed just one home, stopping at the recycling facility. Paintings of Pele, often portrayed as a woman cradling fire in her hands, hang in shops. Visitors can dine at Pele‚s Kitchen or stay at a bed-and-breakfast near Volcanoes National Park called Pele‚s Breath. A popular bumper sticker on the four-wheel-drive trucks that ply the bumpy back roads around Pahoa proclaims, ‚Pele is my homegirl.‚Some newcomers express an almost erotic fascination with Pele, comparing the experience of getting so close to steaming lava flows to sensual experiences.Richard Schott, 34, a bearded Pennsylvanian who moved here after teaching English in South Korea, trekked barefoot to a remote location in the Malama-Ki Forest Reserve over the weekend where he giddily performed yoga positions within feet of the lava flow.Mr. Schott, who goes by the moniker Son of Pele on social media, grinned as the police called on him to retreat. ‚The energy I‚m feeling after seeing Pele up close is beyond anything I‚ve ever experienced,‚ said Mr. Schott, racing over the jungle floor without shoes.There are some kanaka maoli, as Native Hawaiians call themselves in their resurgent language, who express irritation over such interpretations of Pele, contending that the deity is growing angry with outsiders settling in the forest without thoroughly learning about her ways.‚It‚s not the outsiders‚ fault,‚ said Mr. Awai, the hula teacher, who has recited chants in recent weeks in an effort to appease the goddess. He emphasized that Puna, the region of the Big Island that is home to Kilauea, holds a position of religious significance in Hawaii that is unfamiliar to some newcomers. ‚Puna is to believers of Pele what the Vatican City is to Roman Catholics,‚ Mr. Awai said. ‚The outsiders, some of them, they don‚t know any better.‚Written tales in Hawaiian of Pele flourished in the 19th century, but after Americans outlawed the teaching of the Hawaiian language in schools in 1896 ‚ a restriction enduring until the 1970s ‚ the newspapers in which writers published versions of Pele‚s ways went under.In their place, white writers like the mythologist Nathaniel Emerson published their own simplified descriptions of the deity, producing caricatures of her as an excitable goddess or irritable old woman. A new generation of Hawaiian scholars is now seeking to describe Pele in her full complexity.Doing so, however, involves dealing head-on with a deity who remains sacred for many Native Hawaiians. Some feel at ease describing how stoic they can be in accepting the destruction unleashed by Pele, while others express hesitance about divulging too much information about a figure of extreme importance to many people here.Some in the lava‚s path are embracing the uncertainty involved in their deity‚s dance around the island.‚Pele is a shape-shifter who can easily appear in human form,‚ said Ms. Puha, the hula dancer and evacuee who is waiting to see if Pele destroys her home. ‚If you see her hitchhiking, pick her up. If you have a bottle of gin, even better. Pele, like her descendants, likes a little mischief.‚","Madame Pele, Hawaii‚Äôs Goddess of Volcanoes, Awes Those Living in Lava‚Äôs Path","May 27, 2018 /  2:11 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hawaii-volcano-pele/living-with-a-volcano-means-dealing-with-its-goddess-idUSKCN1IS0EZ,"PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - During one of his daily briefings about the relentless eruptions of the Kilauea volcano recently, Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim noted the day had brought no eruptions, no lava, no ashfalls.

REUTERS/Marco Garcia/File Photo  “Pele has given the grace of quiet to us today,” Kim told residents, both native Hawaiians and those who moved there from abroad, at the Pahoa high school meeting. He took it for granted they all knew he was talking about the legendary goddess that lives in the Halemaumau crater of Kilauea, which has been almost continuously active since 1983. Living under one of the world’s most active volcanoes means learning to live with a fickle force of nature, personified by Pele. Pele oversees “any and all volcanic phenomenon: lava flow, steam, fumes, earthquakes,” says Bobby Camara, a retired Park Ranger at the vast Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, the biggest tourist attraction on Hawaii’s Big Island. “She is the reason we are here. She made Hawaii,” he says, referring to the fact the Hawaii Islands were formed from undersea volcanic eruptions. Signs of Pele can be seen everywhere. FILE PHOTO: A depiction of the Hawaiian goddess Pele is seen hanging on the wall of a local restaurant in Pahoa, Hawaii, U.S., May 25, 2018.  REUTERS/Marco Garcia/File Photo  Paintings of her in the gift shops and galleries of Pahoa town by the slopes of Kilauea typically portray a women with long, flowing hair in the shape of a volcano, hands cupping a ball of fire or dressed in a fiery garment.  A homage to Pele is usually featured in Hula dance performances on the Big Island. “Pele’s hair” are wispy strands of glass formed out of the lava fountains erupting from ground fissures in communities around the volcano. The wind has scattered her “hair” far and wide, and can be seen hanging from trees and telephone poles.  She features in Hawaii’s famous Hula dances, including one named Kilauea, with the lyrics:  “At the heights of Kīlauea,  A lava flow from the Kilauea volcano illuminates the night sky, in the Leilani Estates near Pahoa, Hawaii, U.S., May 26, 2018.  REUTERS/Marco GarciaAre seen the fires of the woman.  Pele, the woman, dances,  Surging back and forth.” Residents of Leilani Gardens, who were evacuated after lava fountains erupted from several fissures there, have placed offerings of flowers and ti leaves, used to make Leis, on the oozing lava flows. They are allowed back into the neighborhood to check on their homes for a period each day. For some, it’s also a chance to watch the pyrotechnic eruptions. “This is my second experience of an amazing display of Pele’s power,” says Hannique Ruder, 65, “It’s devastating and beautiful at the same time. We’re all in fear of her power, and yet you have to see the creative force at work here as well.”  Glenn Canon, 61, a retired respiratory therapist, and his wife were also among those evacuated from Leilani Gardens. He’s now planning to move to a rental home in Hilo, far from the volcano. “We don’t want to leave. We settled in for our retirement and planned to stay right there. It looks like Madame Pele has other plans for us. This is her land and when she wants it back, she’ll take it from us.”    Additional reporting by Jolyn Rosa in Honolulu and Marco Garcia in Pahoa, Hawaii; Writing by Bill Tarrant; Editing by Sandra MalerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Living with a volcano means dealing with its goddess,W

Nobukazu Kuriki, 36, was found dead near camp 2 at about 6,400 meters (20,997 feet) on the 8,850-metre (29,035-feet) mountain, tourism department official Gyanendra Shrestha said from base camp.  “Sherpas found his body inside the tent,” Shrestha told Reuters. Details of the incident are not immediately available due to poor communication with the higher camp, he said. Kuriki had made seven unsuccessful attempts to scale Everest.  Japanese climber Kuriki Nobukazu speaks during an interview in Kathmandu, August 22, 2015. A Japanese climber will be the first to attempt to scale Mount Everest since a massive earthquake in April triggered avalanches that killed 18 climbers, shutting an industry that feeds thousands of people across Nepal. Picture taken on August 22, 2015. REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar In 2012, Kuriki spent two days in a snow hole at 27,000 feet (8,230 meters) on Everest in temperatures below minus 20 Celsius. That was when he had to have his fingertips amputated. Macedonian Gjeorgi Petkov, 63, died at the weekend climbing Everest, hiking officials said without giving details. Scores of climbers have successfully made it to the top of Everest this month taking the benefit of good weather, officials said. Nepal has allowed more than 340 foreign climbers to ascend the peak during the current season which started in March and continues through this month.

With 72 dead, including Logan, it was among the worst peacetime disasters in the British capital.‚Our sleeping angel, he was,‚ said Logan‚s father, Marcio Gomes, choking back sobs as he presented photographs and tributes to the baby who was delivered, lifeless, in a hospital after Mr. Gomes, his wife and two daughters escaped their apartment on the 21st floor. He recalled holding the dead infant, ‚hoping it was all a bad dream,‚ and the child looking like ‚he was just sleeping, as babies do.‚Logan‚s birth had been expected more than two months later, around Aug. 21, and his family had been planning for the arrival with joy and some attention to detail, his father said. ‚At least we were able to hold him and be with him,‚ Mr. Gomes said. ‚This has been our hardest battle,‚ he added. ‚You only know what you are made of when you are broken.‚Mr. Gomes was the first of many survivors of the Grenfell blaze and family members of victims who plan to chronicle their experiences over the first nine days of the public inquiry. Such endeavors in Britain are often conducted in the language of lawyers trained in the dry arts of dispassion in their quest for truth and explanations. But those in charge of the Grenfell inquiry ‚ including its chair, Martin Moore-Bick, a retired senior judge ‚ have been under pressure to show that this investigation is about more than the technicalities of building regulations or fire precautions.The dead were ‚not just names, they were people,‚ Natasha Elcock, a survivor of the fire, told the BBC. ‚The public deserve to hear the wonderful characters that were in that block‚ and ‚what it is that we have lost as a community,‚ she added, ‚to try to get some understanding that this should never have happened.‚In his pinstripe suit and rimless glasses, the silver-haired Mr. Moore-Bick seemed to acknowledge that argument.‚During the coming days, there will be much sorrow,‚ he said. ‚That sorrow will, I hope, be tempered by memories of past happiness.‚The narratives to be offered by the survivors ‚are an integral part of the evidence,‚ he added, after asking those attending to stand for 72 seconds of silence to commemorate the victims. The investigation‚s formal agenda includes a wide array of technical issues relating to the circumstances and causes of the blaze, the design of the building, modifications to its structure since it was completed in 1974 and the ‚scope and adequacy‚ of building regulations. The public inquiry is not the only attempt to explain what happened. Police investigators have been charged with discovering whether crimes were committed. Just last week, a separate inquiry by a government-appointed engineer, Judith Hackitt, concluded that Britain‚s building safety regulations were lax and confused.But Ms. Hackitt‚s 159-page report stopped short of recommending a ban on flammable facades, particularly the kind of cladding that proved to be a critical element in the rapid spread of the Grenfell fire.The public inquiry will be conducted in the context of a far deeper tangle of political maneuvering and passions. Survivors have depicted the blaze as an emblem of official indifference toward ordinary people living ‚ and dying ‚ in social housing in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, one of London‚s wealthiest areas.‚This should be a really seminal inquiry, and you can‚t get it right unless you have the community at the heart of it,‚ said Diane Abbott, a senior lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party. ‚Grenfell is more than the sum of its parts. It is the technical aspects of how the fire started, but there are also broader issues that we need to touch on.‚‚We need to dig down and find out why those people weren‚t listened to,‚ Ms. Abbott told the BBC. ‚Had they been listened to before the fire, the fire would not have happened,‚ she continued. ‚It is all about giving people a voice. They said over and over that there would be this type of disaster, and tragically this disaster happened.‚Anne-Marie Murphy, whose 56-year-old brother Denis died on the 14th floor of the tower block, told the inquiry on Monday: ‚Ever since Denis has been gone, there has been a gaping hole in our hearts that can never be filled, and it hurts. It really hurts.‚",Grenfell Tower Inquiry Opens in London With Focus on Victims,"June 6, 2018 /  12:14 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-fire/man-whose-apartment-was-origin-of-londons-grenfell-tower-blaze-is-blameless-inquiry-hears-idUSKCN1J21G8,"LONDON (Reuters) - The man in whose apartment a huge fire broke out, killing 71 people in a London tower block a year ago, was not to blame for the disaster but has been subjected to “sleazy accusations” and innuendo, his lawyer told a public inquiry on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, the lawyer for Kebede, who is originally from Ethiopia, called for the inquiry to clear him of any responsibility for the blaze, Britain’s deadliest on domestic premises since World War Two which raised questions about UK social housing, building regulations and fire safety rules. “Mr Kebede hopes that having heard all the evidence, the inquiry will make a clear and unequivocal statement that Mr Kebede was absolutely blameless for the outbreak of the fire, its spread and its fatal consequences,” lawyer Rajiv Menon said. “If the inquiry does not explicitly exonerate Mr Kebede all the sleazy accusations and hurtful innuendo, all the racist assumptions and ignorance about Mr Kebede that currently prevail will continue unabated.” Menon said that shortly before 1 a.m. on June 14, Kebede, who had lived in the block for about 25 years, was woken by his smoke alarm. He opened his kitchen door to see smoke coming from behind his Hotpoint fridge freezer, which he had bought new five years earlier.

REUTERS/Neil Hall/File PhotoHe called the emergency services before alerting his neighbors by banging on their doors and shouting “fire”. Menon said Kebede had left without any clothes or possessions and that claims he had packed a suitcase before raising the alarm were a nasty lie.  Completed in 1974, Grenfell Tower was owned by the local authority of one of London’s richest boroughs, Kensington and Chelsea. It was refurbished between 2012 and 2016, and fire safety experts have told the inquiry that several aspects of those recent works had made the tower unsafe. In particular, the building was enveloped in a combustible cladding which ignited and the flames raced to the top of the building in minutes. The blaze, which is also subject to a separate criminal investigation, highlighted the area’s extreme disparities in living conditions between rich and poor, with allegations that the cladding had been added purely to improve its visual impact. “The question must be asked whether the refurbishment was simply about beautifying the tower,” Leslie Thomas, lawyer for some of the bereaved families and survivors, told the inquiry. “It is a legitimate question to ask whether the money spent on the tower was not for the residents but for some of the more wealthier people living in the borough, so that the tower was more aesthetically pleasing to them.” Editing by Stephen AddisonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Man whose apartment was origin of London's Grenfell Tower blaze is blameless, inquiry hears",Y

His resignation ends a long-running dispute over whether the Labour Party should expel Mr. Livingstone, 72, who had fought disciplinary proceedings against him. His membership in the party had become a growing embarrassment to the leadership.

The legislation will leave fewer than 10 big banks in the United States subject to stricter federal oversight, freeing thousands of banks with less than $250 billion in assets from a post-crisis crackdown that they have long complained is too onerous.Republican lawmakers and the banking industry cheered a measure they said would help unshackle banks ‚ and the economy ‚ from regulatory burdens. Paul D. Ryan, the House Speaker and Wisconsin Republican, said the bill‚s passage was a step toward ‚freeing our economy from overregulation.‚‚Our smaller banks are engines of growth,‚ he said in a statement. ‚By lending to small businesses and offering banking services for consumers, these institutions are and will remain vital for millions of Americans who participate in our economy.‚The push to alter even a portion of Dodd-Frank so soon after the crisis and just ahead of the midterm elections has pitted Democratic lawmakers against one another. Party leaders are eager to present a united front to voters in November and are wary of losing a signature issue ‚ holding Wall Street accountable.‚It‚s a bad bill under the guise of helping community banks,‚ Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic minority leader, said during debate on the House floor on Tuesday. ‚The bill would take us back to the days when unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited an historic financial meltdown.‚[Read more about the Dodd-Frank rollback.]The Dodd-Frank bill was a Democrat-led initiative that passed with the support of just three Republicans and it has been under constant attack from Republicans ever since. Left-leaning lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio have blasted their more moderate colleagues, like Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, for supporting the legislation, and Democratic leaders have tried to prevent any lawmakers from crossing the aisle to support the bill. ‚For years, armies of bank lobbyists & executives have groaned about how financial rules are hurting them,‚ Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter ahead of the House vote. ‚But there‚s a big problem with their story ‚ banks are making record profits. Congress has done enough favors for big banks ‚ the House should reject the #BankLobbyistAct.‚Ms. Pelosi and Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, wrote a letter to their House colleagues urging them not to support the bill. ‚We must not allow the G.O.P. Congress to drag us back to the same lack of oversight that ignited the Great Recession,‚ they wrote.The overtures did not prevent several Democrats from crossing party lines in favor of the legislation ‚ 33 Democrats voted for it, and one Republican, Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, voted against it.Democrats have pointed to record profits on Wall Street, saying banks do not need relief from rules given how flush they are with cash. A report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Tuesday said that the combined net income of the nation‚s commercial banks and savings institutions reached $56 billion in the first quarter of 2018, a 27.5 percent increase from a year ago.Once the bill is signed by Mr. Trump, small and medium-sized banks will no longer be required to undergo ‚stress tests‚ aimed at measuring their ability to withstand a severe economic downturn. The legislation also offers a reprieve to big ‚ but not behemoth ‚ banks, allowing large institutions like American Express and BB & T to no longer be deemed ‚systemically important‚ and subject to stricter oversight.The bill also exempts some loan originators, including small lenders, from certain disclosure requirements under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Democrats say this will open the door to discriminatory practices because the rules required collection of credit scores, loan amounts and interest rates in an effort to expose redlining and lending discrimination.While the legislation does little to help the very largest banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, the Trump administration has been working behind the scenes through its regulatory agencies to weaken capital requirements and ease other restrictions on such firms. Later this month, five regulators are expected to release a plan to water-down the Volcker Rule, which bans banks from making risky bets with depositors‚ money. Regulators have already proposed easing limits on how much the largest banks can borrow, a change that was opposed by Obama administration appointees at the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who argued it was too soon to reduce capital requirements for the biggest banks. And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is run by Mr. Trump‚s budget director, has halted the agency‚s continuing investigations into finance companies.Republicans saw Tuesday‚s vote as merely the beginning, not the end, of the Dodd-Frank legislative rollback.For years, House Republicans have been pushing for a more significant overhaul of Dodd-Frank and last year passed the Financial Choice Act, which would have crippled the consumer bureau and revoked the Volcker Rule. However, that bill stood no chance of gaining Democratic support in the Senate and Republicans, looking to score a victory before the midterm elections, ultimately chose the pragmatic path of approving the bipartisan Senate legislation.Republicans, and some Democrats, say that the Dodd-Frank law has unnecessarily hurt small- and medium-sized banks that did not play a role in the financial crisis and have been collateral damage in Washington‚s campaign to corral their bigger brethren. They say the regulations have cut off the flow of credit to many Americans who depend on smaller banks for business and personal loans.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the bill was a victory for Americans who depend on small banks and credit unions.‚The Main Street banks and credit unions that these people depend on, they‚ve been suffering, they‚ve been suffering for years under the weight, the load, the volume, the complexity and cost of heavy Washington bureaucratic red tape,‚ he said.Mr. Hensarling said he remained hopeful that the Senate would consider some of the other, smaller deregulation bills that the House has passed, but their fates remain uncertain. Aaron Cutler, a former senior policy adviser to House Republicans and now a partner at Hogan Lovells, said the bill was just a first step. ‚Hopefully this is the first of many legislative pieces to come that improve financial regulations,‚ he said.Conservative groups that have been strong opponents of Dodd-Frank say more must be done to fix the regulatory overreach created by the crisis.‚The legislation unfortunately leaves intact the bulk of Dodd-Frank, including its most crushing burdens on consumers, investors, and entrepreneurs,‚ said John Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank. ‚To provide real financial relief for Americans, much more is required of Congress, the president and regulatory agencies.‚To those who lived through the financial crisis, the deregulatory efforts have prompted concern.Sarah Bloom Raskin, who was deputy Treasury Secretary during the Obama administration, said she was worried about the cumulative effect of the Trump administration‚s deregulatory efforts. She said that there has been a troubling lack of economic analysis about the policies that are being put in place.‚Overall resilience is being weakened in unexamined ways,‚ Ms. Raskin said.Senior White House officials said after the bill passed that they hoped to get it to Mr. Trump‚s desk for signing before Memorial Day. While they would not say that it fulfilled the president‚s promise of repealing Dodd-Frank, they called it an important step toward ridding the economy of regulations that have held back growth.",Congress Approves First Big Dodd-Frank Rollback,"May 22, 2018 /  10:23 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-house-banks-lobbying/update-1-small-banks-trump-wall-street-on-dodd-frank-rewrite-idUSL2N1SU006,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress on Tuesday rolled back some of the restraints imposed on banks after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, but big players like Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), will not be breaking out the champagne. While Wall Street banks lobbied hard for a range of provisions that would have weakened the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law and boosted their profits, they got trumped by their smaller rivals, according to lobbyists, Congressional staff, bankers and disclosure records.   For example, the bill reduces federal oversight of banks between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets, and eases lending, capital and trading rules for smaller lenders, but big bank lobbyists and analysts agree it does little to help the nation’s largest lenders.     Large banks sought to raise that oversight threshold to $500 billion, or adopt a more flexible approach to big bank scrutiny, but small banks fought to fix the cap at $250 billion, concerned about alienating Democrats whose votes were needed to pass the bill in the Senate. “We fought anything that would be added to the bill for the mega banks that would jeopardize the effort,” said Paul Merski, executive vice president at the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), the main small bank lobby group, whose members have around $430 million in assets on average.  “We managed to get this legislation done in spite of the mega banks.” Tuesday’s vote marks a major bipartisan legislative victory for President Donald Trump’s administration, which has promised to spur more economic growth by rolling back regulations. OUTFOXED ON CAPITOL HILL But while Trump-appointed regulators have been cutting Wall Street some slack in how they apply the rules, the rewrite showed how small banks outmaneuvered their big rivals on Capitol Hill, where Wall Street is still struggling to shake off its negative image. One such accomplishment was the change in the bill that eased capital, lending and trading rules based on asset-size limits, rather than by firm type or activities, making it tougher for big banks to sneak in under the radar. In many cases this was set at $10 billion.   Dodd-Frank aimed to protect consumers from predatory lenders and mitigate systemic risk, but banks of all sizes have argued its burdens were excessive and have lobbied to reform the law. Yet since the crisis, small banks have fought aggressively to distance themselves from the “too-big-to-fail” Wall Street titans bailed out to the tune of $700 billion in 2008.  This tension has sometimes spilled into public view, with JP Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon calling Camden Fine, who retired from his longtime role as ICBA chief this month, a “jerk” during a 2016 TV interview. Banks’ lobbying gained momentum after Republicans took control of Congress and the White House in 2016, but it was community banks which were able to wage a grassroots campaign to win over skeptical Democrats and secure their votes. Slideshow (3 Images)Armed with government data that showed the number of community lenders fell from around 8,400 in 2007 to around 5,500 today, they targeted moderates in states with many small banks but ideally no big players. “This bill was perfectly crafted to allow greater flexibility for small community banks and credit unions...so it is purposeful that this bill does not include provisions for the largest banks,” North Dakota’s Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a key sponsor of the bill, told Reuters on Tuesday.  “The highest priorities for the largest institutions are nowhere to be found,” said Heitkamp, adding she had not committed to further easing of capital markets rules sought by banks. Many of the Democratic backers, including Heitkamp, Montana’s Jon Tester and Indiana’s Joe Donnelly, are facing tough mid-term races in which pro-growth credentials and endorsements from small businesses could help swing votes, said analysts.  The Montana Bankers Association recently fielded its members to star in a commercial urging watchers to vote for Tester because he put politics aside “to cut red tape”. “We wrote this bill to defend Montana businesses from overreaching government regulations,” Tester said in a statement on Tuesday evening. Donnelly’s office recognized the support of the ICBA among a raft of other local business groups and said the bill “maintains the key elements of Dodd-Frank”.  Congress has not handed the small banks everything they asked for. For example, a farm bill including measures helpful to small banks was voted down by the House this month. Many Democrats and consumer advocates, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, also say the bill’s provisions on custody banks and bonds could be exploited by the big banks, potentially increasing systemic risk. Still, big bank lobbyists privately say the Dodd-Frank rewrite, though a positive signal, did not go far enough. Among the changes Wall Street banks sought, but did not get were: anointing a single regulator to oversee the Volcker Rule banning proprietary trading; weakening the top U.S. consumer watchdog; loosening liquidity rules and requirements for “living wills.”  “Banks of all sizes have spent eight years explaining to lawmakers and regulators why the rules put in place by Dodd-Frank were not all working as intended,” Ian McKendry, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association, which represents banks big and small, said in a statement. “We think this is an important step forward, but there is more to do.” Reporting by Michelle Price and Pete Schroeder; additional reporting by Katanga Johnson; Editing by Tomasz Janowski and Lisa ShumakerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Small banks trump Wall Street on Dodd-Frank rewrite,W

He was 85.The writer Judith Thurman, a close friend, said the cause was congestive heart failure. Mr. Roth had homes in Manhattan and Connecticut.In the course of a very long career, Mr. Roth took on many guises ‚ mainly versions of himself ‚ in the exploration of what it means to be an American, a Jew, a writer, a man. He was a champion of Eastern European novelists like Ivan Klima and Bruno Schulz, and also a passionate student of American history and the American vernacular. And more than just about any other writer of his time, he was tireless in his exploration of male sexuality.His creations include Alexander Portnoy, a teenager so libidinous, he has sex with both his baseball mitt and the family dinner, and David Kepesh, a professor who turns into an exquisitely sensitive 155-pound female breast. Mr. Roth was the last of the great white males: the triumvirate of writers ‚ Saul Bellow and John Updike were the others ‚ who towered over American letters in the second half of the 20th century. Outliving both and borne aloft by an extraordinary second wind, Mr. Roth wrote more novels than either of them. In 2005 he became only the third living writer (after Bellow and Eudora Welty) to have his books enshrined in the Library of America.[New to Philip Roth? Here‚s how to get started on reading his books.]‚Updike and Bellow hold their flashlights out into the world, reveal the world as it is now,‚ Mr. Roth once said. ‚I dig a hole and shine my flashlight into the hole.‚ The Nobel Prize eluded Mr. Roth, but he won most of the other top honors: two National Book Awards, two National Book Critics Circle awards, three PEN/Faulkner Awards, a Pulitzer Prize and the Man Booker International Prize.In his 60s, a time of life when many writers are winding down, he produced an exceptional sequence of historical novels ‚ ‚American Pastoral,‚ ‚The Human Stain‚ and ‚I Married a Communist‚ ‚ products of his personal re-engagement with America and American themes. And starting with ‚Everyman‚ in 2006, when he was 73, he kept up a relentless book-a-year pace, publishing works that while not necessarily major were nevertheless fiercely intelligent and sharply observed. Their theme in one way or another was the ravages of age and mortality itself, and in publishing them he seemed to be defiantly staving off his own decline.Mr. Roth was often lumped together with Bellow and Bernard Malamud as part of the ‚Hart, Schaffner & Marx of American letters,‚ but he resisted the label. ‚The epithet American-Jewish writer has no meaning for me,‚ he said. ‚If I‚m not an American, I‚m nothing.‚And yet, almost against his will sometimes, he was drawn again and again to writing about themes of Jewish identity, anti-Semitism and the Jewish experience in America. He returned often, especially in his later work, to the Weequahic neighborhood of Newark, where he had grown up and which became in his writing a kind of vanished Eden: a place of middle-class pride, frugality, diligence and aspiration.[Click here to read about how readers reacted to Philip Roth‚s death.]It was a place where no one was unaware ‚of the power to intimidate that emanated from the highest and lowest reaches of gentile America,‚ he wrote, and yet where being Jewish and being American were practically indistinguishable. Speaking of his father in ‚The Facts,‚ an autobiography, Mr. Roth said: ‚His repertoire has never been large: family, family, family, Newark, Newark, Newark, Jew, Jew, Jew. Somewhat like mine.‚ Reality and Fiction BlurMr. Roth‚s favorite vehicle for exploring this repertoire was himself, or rather one of several fictional alter egos he deployed as a go-between, negotiating the tricky boundary between autobiography and invention and deliberately blurring the boundaries between real life and fiction. Nine of Mr. Roth‚s novels are narrated by Nathan Zuckerman, a novelist whose career closely parallels that of his creator. Three more are narrated by David Kepesh, a writerly academic who shares some of Mr. Roth‚s preoccupations, women especially. And sometimes Mr. Roth dispensed with the disguise altogether ‚ or seemed to.The protagonist of ‚Operation Shylock‚ is a character named Philip Roth, who is being impersonated by another character, who stole Roth‚s identity. At the center of ‚The Plot Against America,‚ a book that invents an America where Charles Lindbergh wins the 1940 presidential election and initiates a secret pogrom against Jews, is a New Jersey family named Roth that resembles the author‚s in every particular. ‚Making fake biography, false history, concocting a half-imaginary existence out of the actual drama of my life is my life,‚ Mr. Roth told Hermione Lee in a 1984 interview in The Paris Review. ‚There has to be some pleasure in this life, and that‚s it.‚Occasionally, as in ‚Deception,‚ a slender 1990 novel about a writer named Philip who is writing about a writer having an affair with one of his made-up characters, this sleight of hand feels stuntlike and a little dizzying. More often, and especially in ‚The Counterlife‚ (1986), Mr. Roth‚s masterpiece in this vein, what results is a profound investigation into the competing and overlapping claims of fiction and reality, in which each aspires to the condition of the other and the very idea of a self becomes a fabrication at once heroic and treacherous.Mr. Roth‚s other great theme was sex, or male lust, which in his books is both a life force and a principle of rage and disorder. It is sex, the uncontrollable need to have it, that torments poor, guilt-ridden Portnoy, almost certainly Mr. Roth‚s most famous character, who desperately wants to ‚be bad ‚ and to enjoy it.‚ And Mickey Sabbath, the protagonist of ‚Sabbath‚s Theater,‚ one of Mr. Roth‚s major late-career novels, is in many ways Portnoy grown old but still in the grip of lust and longing, raging against the indignity of old age and yet saved from suicidal impulses by the realization that there are too many people he loves to hate.In public Mr. Roth, tall and good-looking, was gracious and charming but with little use for small talk. In private he was a gifted mimic and comedian. Friends used to say that if his writing career had ever fizzled he could have made a nice living doing stand-up. But there was about his person, as about his writing, a kind of simmering intensity, an impatience with art that didn‚t take itself seriously.Some writers ‚pretend to be more lovable than they are and some pretend to be less,‚ he told Ms. Lee. ‚Beside the point. Literature isn‚t a moral beauty contest. Its power arises from the authority and audacity with which the impersonation is pulled off; the belief it inspires is what counts.‚Philip Milton Roth was born in Newark on March 19, 1933, the younger of two sons. (His brother, Sanford, a commercial artist known as Sandy, died in 2009.) His father, Herman, was an insurance manager for Metropolitan Life who felt that his career had been thwarted by the gentile executives who ran the company. Mr. Roth once described him as a cross between Captain Ahab and Willy Loman. His mother, the former Bess Finkel, was a secretary before she married and then became a housekeeper of the heroic old school ‚ the kind, he once suggested, who raised cleaning to an art form. The family lived in a five-room apartment on Summit Avenue within which were only three books when he was growing up ‚ given as presents when someone was ill, Mr. Roth said. He went to Weequahic High, where he was a good student but not good enough to win a scholarship to Rutgers, as he had hoped. In 1951 he enrolled as a pre-law student at the Newark branch of Rutgers, with vague notions of becoming ‚a lawyer for the underdog.‚But he yearned to live away from home, and the following year he transferred to Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pa., a place about which he knew almost nothing except that a Newark neighbor seemed to have thrived there. Inspired by one of his professors, Mildred Martin, with whom he remained a lasting friend, Mr. Roth switched his interests from law to literature. He helped found a campus literary magazine, where in an early burst of his satirical power he published a parody of the college newspaper so devastating that it earned him an admonition from the dean.Mr. Roth graduated from Bucknell, magna cum laude, in 1954 and won a scholarship to the University of Chicago, where he was awarded an M.A. in 1955. That same year, rather than wait for the draft, he enlisted in the Army but suffered a back injury during basic training and received a medical discharge. He returned to Chicago in 1956 to study for a Ph.D. in English but dropped out after one term.Irritating the RabbisMr. Roth had begun to write and publish short stories by then, and in 1959 he won a Houghton Mifflin Fellowship to publish what became his first collection, ‚Goodbye, Columbus.‚ It won the National Book Award in 1960 but was denounced ‚ in an inkling of trouble to come ‚ by some influential rabbis, who objected to the portrayal of the worldly, assimilated Patimkin family in the title novella, and even more to the story ‚Defender of the Faith,‚ about a Jewish Army sergeant plagued by goldbricking draftees of his own faith. In 1962, while appearing on a panel at Yeshiva University, Mr. Roth was so denounced, for that story especially, that he resolved never to write about Jews again. He quickly changed his mind.‚My humiliation before the Yeshiva belligerents ‚ indeed, the angry Jewish resistance that I aroused virtually from the start ‚ was the luckiest break I could have had,‚ he wrote. ‚I was branded.‚ Mr. Roth later called his first two novels ‚apprentice work.‚ ‚Letting Go,‚ published in 1962, was derived in about equal parts from Bellow and Henry James. ‚When She Was Good,‚ which came out in 1967, is the most un-Rothian of his books, a Theodore Dreiser- or Sherwood Anderson-like story set in the WASP Midwest in the 1940s.‚When She Was Good‚ was based in part on the life and family of Margaret Martinson Williams, with whom Mr. Roth had entered a calamitous relationship in 1959. Ms. Williams, who was divorced and had a son and a daughter, met Mr. Roth while she was waiting tables in Chicago, and she tricked him into marriage by pretending to be pregnant. He was ‚enslaved‚ to her own sense of victimization, he wrote. They separated in 1963, but Ms. Williams refused to divorce, and she remained a vexatious presence in his life until she died in a car crash in 1968. (She appears as Josie Jensen in ‚The Facts‚ and, more or less undisguised, as the exasperating Maureen Tarnopol in Mr. Roth‚s novel ‚My Life as a Man.‚)After the separation, Mr. Roth moved back East and began work on ‚Portnoy‚s Complaint,‚ which surely set a record for most masturbation scenes per page. It was a breakthrough not just for Mr. Roth but for American letters, which had never known anything like it: an extended, unhinged monologue, at once filthy and hilarious, by a neurotic young Jewish man trying to break free of his suffocating parents and tormented by a longing to have sex with gentile women, shiksas.The book was ‚an experiment in verbal exuberance,‚ Mr. Roth said, and it deliberately broke all the rules.ImageMr. Roth published ‚Portnoy‚s Complaint‚ in 1969. It was an extended, unhinged monologue, at once filthy and hilarious, by a neurotic young Jewish man trying to break free of his suffocating parents.The novel, published in 1969, became a best seller but received mixed reviews. Josh Greenfeld, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called it ‚the very novel that every American-Jewish writer has been trying to write in one guise or another since the end of World War II.‚On the other hand, Irving Howe (on whom Mr. Roth later modeled the pompous, stuffy critic Milton Appel in ‚The Anatomy Lesson‚) wrote in a lengthy takedown in 1972, ‚The cruelest thing anyone can do with ‚Portnoy‚s Complaint‚ is read it twice.‚ And once again the rabbis complained. Gershom Scholem, the great kabbalah scholar, declared that the book was more harmful to Jews than ‚The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.‚Mr. Roth‚s autobiographical phase began in 1974 with ‚My Life as a Man,‚ which he said was probably the least factually altered of his books, and continued with the Zuckerman trilogy ‚ ‚The Ghost Writer‚ (1979), ‚Zuckerman Unbound‚ (1981) and ‚The Anatomy Lesson‚ (1983) ‚ which examined the authorial vocation and even the nature of writing itself.Zuckerman reappeared in ‚The Counterlife‚ (1986), where he seems to die of a heart attack and is then resurrected. ‚Operation Shylock‚ (1993), which Mr. Roth pretended was a ‚confession,‚ not a novel (though in the very last sentence he says, ‚This confession is false‚), involved two Roths, one real and one phony, and the real one claims to have been a spy for the Mossad. The book, with its sense of shifting reality and unstable identity, partly stemmed from a near-breakdown Mr. Roth experienced when he became addicted to the sleeping pill Halcion after knee surgery in 1987 and from severe depression he suffered after emergency bypass surgery in 1989.For much of this time Mr. Roth had been spending half the year in London with the actress Claire Bloom, with whom he began living in 1976. They married in 1990 but divorced four years later. In 1996, Ms. Bloom published a memoir, ‚Leaving the Doll‚s House,‚ in which she depicted him as a misogynist and control freak, so self-involved that he refused to let her daughter, from her marriage to the actor Rod Steiger, live with them because she bored him. Never fond of attention, Mr. Roth became even more reclusive after this accusation and never publicly replied to it, though he privately denied it. Some critics found unflattering parallels to Ms. Bloom and her daughter in the characters Eve Frame and her daughter, Sylphid, in ‚I Married a Communist.‚An American TrilogyThe marriage over, Mr. Roth moved permanently back to the United States and began what proved to be the third major phase of his career. He returned, he said, because he felt out of touch: ‚It was really my rediscovering America as a writer.‚ ‚Sabbath‚s Theater,‚ which came out in 1995 and won the National Book Award, is about neither Roth nor Zuckerman but rather Morris Sabbath, known as Mickey, an ex-puppeteer in his 60s. His voice is nothing if not American: an angry, comic, lustful harangue.‚In this new book life is represented as anarchic horniness on the rampage against death and its harbingers, old age and impotence,‚ Frank Kermode wrote in The New York Review of Books, adding, ‚There is really only one way for him to tell the story ‚ defiantly with outraged phallic energy.‚Like ‚Portnoy‚s Complaint,‚ ‚Sabbath‚s Theater‚ seemed to liberate its author, and yet the work that followed ‚ what Mr. Roth called his American trilogy: ‚American Pastoral,‚ ‚I Married a Communist‚ and ‚The Human Stain‚ ‚ is less about sex than about history or traumatic moments in American culture. Zuckerman returns as the narrator of all three novels, but he is in his 60s now, impotent and suffering from prostate cancer. His prose is plainer, crisper, less show-offy, and he is less an actor than an observer and interpreter.The books are full of dense reportorial detail ‚ about such seemingly un-Rothian subjects as glove making and ice fishing ‚ as they tell Job-like stories. There is Swede Levov (‚American Pastoral‚), a seemingly gilded Newark businessman, a gifted athlete married to Miss New Jersey of 1949, whose life is destroyed in the 1960s when his teenage daughter becomes an antiwar terrorist and plants a bomb that kills an innocent bystander. Ira Ringold (‚I Married a Communist‚) is a star of a radio serial during the McCarthy era who is blacklisted and becomes the subject of an expos√© published by his own wife. And Coleman Silk (‚The Human Stain), a black classics professor passing as white, commits an innocent classroom gaffe while the Clinton impeachment is taking place and finds himself mercilessly hounded by the politically correct. These books are not without their comic moments, but history here is no joke; it is more nearly a tragedy. In 2007, Mr. Roth killed Zuckerman off in the sad and affecting ‚Exit Ghost,‚ a novel that cleverly echoes and inverts the themes of ‚The Ghost Writer,‚ the first of the Zuckerman novels. Meanwhile he had begun writing a series of shorter novels that, after the publication of ‚Nemesis‚ in 2010, he began calling ‚Nemeses.‚ The sequence began with ‚Everyman,‚ which starts in a graveyard and ends on an operating table.That work set the tone for the rest: ‚Indignation‚ (2008), a ghost story of sorts about a young student unfairly expelled from college and sent off to fight in the Korean War; ‚The Humbling‚ (2009), about an actor who has lost his powers; and ‚Nemesis,‚ about the polio epidemic of the 1950s. The prose became even sparer and, in the case of ‚Nemesis,‚ deliberately matter-of-fact and unliterary, and though the books have plenty of sexual moments, they are haunted by something darker and bleaker. Yet the very existence of these books, coming reliably almost one every year, seemed to belie their message. ‚Time doesn‚t prey on my mind. It should, but it doesn‚t,‚ Mr. Roth told David Remnick in The New Yorker in 2000. He added: ‚I don‚t know yet what this will all add up to, and it no longer matters, because there‚s no stopping. All you want to do is the obvious. Just get it right.‚Some of his novels were adapted for the movies: ‚Goodbye, Columbus‚ in 1969, ‚The Human Stain‚ in 2003 and ‚American Pastoral‚ and ‚Indignation‚ in 2016.Increasingly in his later years, Mr. Roth spent most of his time alone in his 18th-century farmhouse in northwest Connecticut, returning to New York mostly in the winter, when he grew so stir-crazy, he found himself talking to woodchucks. He worked, read in the evenings and occasionally listened to a ballgame. In some ways he came to resemble his own creation, Nathan Zuckerman, who asks at the end of a chapter in ‚Exit Ghost,‚ ‚Isn‚t one‚s pain quotient shocking enough without fictional amplification, without giving things an intensity that is ephemeral in life and sometimes even unseen?‚‚Not for some,‚ he goes on. ‚For some very, very few that amplification, evolving uncertainly out of nothing, constitutes their only assurance, and the unlived, the surmise, fully drawn in print on paper, is the life whose meaning comes to matter most.‚In 2010, right after ‚Nemesis,‚ Mr. Roth decided to quit writing. He didn‚t tell anyone at first, because, as he said, he didn‚t want to be like Frank Sinatra, announcing his retirement one minute and making a comeback the next. But he stuck with his plan, and, in 2012, he officially announced that he was done. A Post-it note on his computer said, ‚The struggle with writing is done.‚He had been famous for putting in endless days at his stand-up desk, throwing out more pages than he kept, and in a 2018 interview he said he was worn out. ‚I was by this time no longer in possession of the mental vitality or the physical fitness needed to mount and sustain a large creative attack of any duration,‚ he said.He settled into the contented life of an Upper West Side retiree, seeing friends, going to concerts. He was in frequent communication with his appointed biographer, Blake Bailey, whom he sometimes flooded with notes, and he was also at pains to straighten out an erroneous Wikipedia account of his life. Mostly, he read ‚ nonfiction by preference, but he made exception for the occasional novel. One of the last he read was ‚Asymmetry,‚ by Lisa Halliday, a book about a young woman who has a romance with an aging novelist who bears an unmistakable resemblance to Mr. Roth ‚ funny, kind, acerbic, passionate, immensely well-read, a devotee of Zabar‚s and old movies.In an interview, Mr. Roth acknowledged that he and Ms. Halliday had been friends, and added: ‚She got me.‚","Philip Roth, Towering Novelist Who Explored Lust, Jewish Life and America, Dies at 85","May 23, 2018 /  3:49 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-philiproth/pulitzer-winning-author-philip-roth-dies-at-85-says-agent-idUSKCN1IO0CM,"(Reuters) - Author Philip Roth, who was both hailed and derided for laying bare the neuroses and obsessions that haunted the modern Jewish-American experience, died on Tuesday at the age of 85, his agent said.  Roth died in New York City at 10:30 p.m. local time of congestive heart failure, his literary agent Andrew Wylie said. Roth wrote more than 30 books, including the 1991 memoir “Patrimony,” which examined his complex relationship with his father and won the National Book Critics Circle Award. In his later years, Roth turned to the existential and sexual crises of middle age, never abandoning his commitment to exploring shame, embarrassment and other guilty secrets of the self, although usually with a heavy dose of humor. After more than 50 years as a writer, Roth decided that 2010’s “Nemesis,” the story of a polio epidemic in the Newark, New Jersey, neighborhood where he grew up, would be his last novel. He then went back and reread all his works “to see whether I’d wasted my time,” he said in a 2014 interview published in the New York Times Book Review.  For his conclusion, he quoted Joe Louis, the heavyweight boxing champion of the 1930s and ‘40s: “I did the best I could with what I had.” In 2017, he published “Why Write?,” a collection of essays and non-fiction works written between 1960 and 2013. Roth’s best-known work was the 1969 novel “Portnoy’s Complaint,” a first-person narrative about Alexander Portnoy, a young middle-class Jewish New Yorker. The book featured several notorious masturbation scenes and a narrator who declared he wanted to “put the id back in yid.” Roth’s first published book was the 1959 novella and short-story collection “Goodbye, Columbus,” which won the National Book Award. Several of his novels, including “Zuckerman Unbound,” “The Ghost Writer” and “The Anatomy Lesson”, feature Nathan Zuckerman, a character who came to be seen as Roth’s fictional alter ego. Roth liked to play with the distinctions between fact and fiction, often writing about neurotic novelists and even naming some characters “Philip.” Yet he was frequently annoyed and amused by readers’ desire to project the real Roth onto his characters. Although his novels often explored the Jewish experience in America, Roth, who said he was an atheist, rejected being labeled a Jewish-American writer. “It’s not a question that interests me. I know exactly what it means to be Jewish and it’s really not interesting,” he told the Guardian newspaper in 2005. “I’m an American.” Some critics said Roth’s novels exposed him as a self-hating Jew who played on negative stereotypes or generally cast Jews in a bad light. He would recall the hostile reception at a symposium at New York’s Yeshiva University in 1962 as the “most bruising public exchange of my life.” FILE PHOTO - Author Philip Roth poses in New York September 15, 2010.  REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File PhotoMULTIPLE HONORS Roth won the Pulitzer Prize for 1997’s “American Pastoral,” which examined the impact of the 1960s on a New Jersey family. He was the first three-time winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award, honored for “Operation Shylock” in 1994, “The Human Stain” in 2001 and “Everyman” in 2007. Roth also received the National Medal of Arts at the White House in 1998. Philip Milton Roth was born on March 19, 1933, in Newark, New Jersey. The son of an insurance salesman, Roth earned a bachelor’s degree at Bucknell University and a master’s degree in English from the University of Chicago. He dropped out of the doctoral program in 1959 to write film reviews for the New Republic before “Goodbye, Columbus” came out. Roth taught comparative literature, mostly at the University of Pennsylvania. He retired from teaching in 1992 as a distinguished professor of literature at New York’s Hunter College. Roth had a long relationship with British actress Claire Bloom but their five-year marriage ended in divorce in 1995. A year later, she published a bruising memoir, “Leaving a Doll’s House,” in which she portrayed him as depressed, remote, self-centered and verbally abusive. Roth had been especially prolific in the years leading to his 2012 retirement from writing, turning out novels nearly every two years. His more recent books included 2001’s “The Dying Animal” and “The Human Stain,” published in 2000 and released in 2003 as a movie starring Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman. “The Plot Against America,” published in 2004, imagines what would have happened had flying ace Charles Lindbergh, an isolationist who expressed anti-Semitic views, defeated Franklin Roosevelt in the 1940 election and signed a peace accord with Adolf Hitler. Following the death of several friends, including novelist Saul Bellow in 2005, Roth wrote “Everyman,” a short work of fiction about the physical decline and death of a successful advertising executive. Roth was considered a difficult interview subject and told the Guardian he disliked discussing his books. “You should let people fight with the books on their own and rediscover what they are and what they are not.” Roth said the act of writing for him is “filled with fear and loneliness and anxiety.” But, he added: “There are some days that compensate completely. In my life I have had, in total, a couple of months of these completely wonderful days as a writer, and that is enough.” In a New York Times interview in 2018, Roth reflected on his 50-plus years as a writer, describing it as: “Exhilaration and groaning. Frustration and freedom. Inspiration and uncertainty. Abundance and emptiness. Blazing forth and muddling through.” Slideshow (2 Images)(This story corrects spelling of Louis’s surname in 6th paragraph and Bucknell in 15th paragraph.)

At that time his family told his school, Gloucester High School, that he was transgender. Administrators were supportive at first and allowed him to use the boys‚ bathroom.But amid an uproar from some parents and students, the school board barred Mr. Grimm from using the boys‚ bathrooms and adopted a policy requiring students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms for their ‚corresponding biological genders.‚ The board added that ‚students with gender identity issues‚ would be allowed to use private bathrooms.The A.C.L.U. argued that requiring Mr. Grimm to use a private bathroom had been humiliating and had, quoting him, ‚turned him into ‚a public spectacle‚ before the entire community, ‚like a walking freak show.‚‚In its statement, the school board said that it ‚continues to believe that its resolution of this complex matter fully considered the interests of all students and parents in the Gloucester County school system.‚",Transgender Student in Bathroom Dispute Wins Court Ruling,"May 22, 2018 /  9:35 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-transgender/u-s-court-backs-transgender-student-at-center-of-bathroom-dispute-idUSKCN1IN305,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday ruled that federal law protects a transgender student who fought all the way to the Supreme Court for the right to use a bathroom at a high school in Virginia that corresponded with his gender identity. Activist Gavin Grimm arrives for the Time 100 Gala in the Manhattan borough of New York, New York, U.S. April 25, 2017. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen in Norfolk rejected a bid by the Gloucester County School Board to dismiss the civil rights lawsuit filed by student Gavin Grimm. The judge said Grimm has valid claims under a federal law, called Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, that bars discrimination on the basis of sex in education as well as the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law. Grimm filed the suit in 2015 and graduated from high school last year. Wright Allen rejected the school board’s argument that its policy was justified by the need to protect the privacy rights of students, saying that “preventing Mr. Grimm from using the boys’ restrooms did nothing to protect the privacy rights of other students, but certainly singled out and stigmatized Mr. Grimm.” Grimm, 19, was born a girl and identifies as male. Grimm had sued the school board to win the right to use the public school’s boys’ bathroom.  Bathroom access has become a major issue in the battle over transgender rights, and Grimm’s suit has been the most prominent legal case on the subject.  “I feel an incredible sense of relief. After fighting this policy since I was 15 years old, I finally have a court decision saying that what the Gloucester County School Board did to me was wrong and it was against the law,” Grimm, who is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. Wright Allen, whose ruling was similar to several others across the United States in favor of transgender students, said the parties should schedule a settlement conference within 30 days. Grimm’s case had previously reached the Supreme Court and was set to be argued in March 2017 when President Donald Trump’s administration rescinded guidance previously issued by the administration of President Barack Obama regarding bathroom access for transgender students. The Obama administration had told public schools nationwide to let transgender students use the bathroom of their choosing. The Supreme Court subsequently sent the case back to lower courts without issuing a ruling on the merits. A spokesman for the school board could not immediately be reached for comment. The school board’s former lawyer, Kyle Duncan, was recently appointed by Trump as a judge on the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Ms. Stojberg pointed in particular to bus drivers and people working in hospitals.Her comments prompted criticism from Muslims and immigration advocates.‚This is a minister who is supposed to strengthen integration and strengthen social cohesion between population groups,‚ said Natasha Al-Hariri, an integration consultant who holds a law degree and is Muslim. ‚But she‚s doing the opposite: She‚s stirring up a debate based on no figures, no statistics and no anecdotes.‚ The office of Ms. Stojberg, whose official title is immigration and integration minister, did not return a call for comment.Members of her center-right Liberal Party, which leads the current government, distanced themselves from her remarks.‚In Denmark there‚s room for everybody ‚ if you believe in Jesus, Allah or Buddha ‚ as long as you mind your duties and take responsibility for your actions,‚ said Fatma Oktem, a party member and former member of Parliament, who was born in Denmark to Turkish parents.A recent Justice Department proposal to ban the wearing of ‚clothing items that cover the face‚ ‚ including burqas ‚ in public was already testing the limits for some party members.Responding to Ms. Stojberg‚s comments, Jacob Jensen, a Liberal member of Parliament, urged fellow politicians in a Facebook post to ‚concentrate on solving real problems first,‚ and added that the management of workers during religious holidays was best left to employers. ‚If a nurse didn‚t eat or had been to a Christmas party, there‚s a head nurse to handle it,‚ he said in an interview on Tuesday. ‚It‚s not something for us politicians to get involved in.‚Arriva, one of Denmark‚s main bus operators, declined to comment on Tuesday, but a spokeswoman was quoted by the Danish newspaper BT as saying that it had never had any accidents involving a driver who was fasting.‚We ran some information campaigns and had a Ramadan flier with advice on how to drive during Ramadan,‚ the spokeswoman, Pia Hammershoy Splittorff, was quoted as saying. ‚We‚ve done that for some years, but have also ascertained it wasn‚t necessary.‚Celebrating Immigration Rules With CakeMs. Stojberg made headlines in March 2017 when she posted a picture of herself on Facebook with a cake celebrating the passing of the country‚s 50th immigration restriction.‚Today the 50th restriction was passed on immigration. This must be celebrated!‚ she wrote in a post that showed her holding the cake, which was decorated with fruit, the number 50 and a Danish flag.The post, which caused an outcry on social media, came at a time when countries across Europe were facing a backlash against immigration and culture wars over national identity.The integration minister also included a link to a list of ministry regulations, such as a law requiring newly arrived asylum seekers to surrender valuables like jewelry and gold to help pay for their stay in the country. Handing Over Assets for Living CostsThat law ‚ which Denmark‚s Parliament passed in January 2016, the same month that the country imposed temporary controls along its border with Germany ‚ required that asylum seekers who entered the country with assets of more than 10,000 kroner, or about $1,250, must help cover the cost of their lodging.Criticized by activists and United Nations officials, the law was amended to exempt ‚objects with sentimental value‚ like wedding and engagement rings and family portraits.Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said at the time that the law‚s purpose was to introduce the same requirements for asylum seekers that the country‚s citizens faced: to use their own resources before qualifying for welfare benefits.The law was applied just four times in the year after being introduced, according to DR, the national broadcaster.Laws in Germany and Switzerland also require asylum seekers with assets exceeding certain amounts to contribute to their living costs.Serving Pork to ChildrenMs. Stojberg also came under criticism in January 2016 for relating an anecdote ‚ later revealed as untrue ‚ that a public day care center in the town of Aalborg had banned children from eating pork, and suggesting that the ban was an outcome of multiculturalism.After the story was discredited, she said she regretted having mentioned it in a speech.The issue of serving pork at schools had wider resonance in the country at the time, however. The town of Randers introduced a policy that month that serving traditional Danish food like pork was essential for preserving national identity. The town council, saying that its intention was not to force anyone to eat something that ‚goes against one‚s belief or religion,‚ deemed that Danish food culture must be a ‚central part of the offering ‚ including serving pork on an equal footing with other foods.‚Critics of the policy said it had been intended to stigmatize Muslims, whose dietary laws, like those for Jews, forbid pork consumption.",Denmark Minister Calls Fasting Muslims ‚Äòa Danger‚Äô in Ramadan,"May 24, 2018 /  5:55 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-afd/german-rightist-calls-for-fasting-muslims-to-be-banned-from-work-during-ramadan-idUSKCN1IP36U,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A lawmaker from the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) called on Thursday for Muslim doctors, nurses, pilots, bus and train drivers to be banned from working during Ramadan if they are fasting. Germany is home to some four million Muslims - including Turks who have lived here for decades as well as migrants and asylum seekers who arrived in the past few years, many fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. AfD politician Martin Sichert said employers who were not able to give fasting Muslims a night or early shift should be able to make them use some of their annual leave during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. “What patient should have to be operated by a surgeon who has not drunk anything for 12 hours?” asked Sichert, a member of the parliamentary committee for labor and social issues. “Why should people have to be transported around by other people who might face concentration problems and dehydration because they have been fasting for hours?” A German government spokesman said he did not want to comment.  Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has faced strong criticism from some Germans for opening the borders to more than a million migrants over the last few years, wants an inclusive, multi-ethnic Germany. She has long stressed Islam is part of Germany and has called for tolerance. Sichert’s comments came after Inger Stojberg, Denmark’s Integration Minister, caused furor on Monday by urging practicing Muslims to take vacation during Ramadan to avoid a negative impact on society. “It can simply be dangerous for all of us if the bus driver doesn’t eat or drink during a whole day, and you don’t perform  at nearly the same level at the factory or the hospital if you don’t eat or drink during the bright hours of the day for a full month,” she said in a letter printed in Danish newspaper BT.

They authorized the court to investigate the 2014 conflict in Gaza.Under the court‚s rules, any member country can request an investigation.The legal maneuver on Tuesday came at a moment of especially high tensions between Israelis and Palestinians after the United States formally relocated its embassy to Jerusalem and the fatal shooting of scores of Palestinians in Gaza whom Israel accused of trying to storm a border fence.Last week another international body, the United Nations Human Rights Council, considered a resolution to ‚urgently dispatch an independent, international commission of inquiry‚ to investigate ‚all alleged violations and abuses‚ of civilians since the latest Gaza protests began on March 30.The Palestinian case against Israel is by far the most high profile and politically sensitive issue to reach the court since it opened in 2002. According to its website, the court is currently investigating 11 ‚situations,‚ the bulk of them in sub-Saharan Africa, involving allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity.Should the court‚s chief prosecutor, currently Fatou Bensouda of Gambia, seek to take up a criminal investigation of Israel, the case faces a series of time-consuming hurdles.Initially, the prosecutor may use open sources to build a case, and it is then up to the court‚s pretrial judges to decide whether the evidence is sufficient to approve a criminal investigation. Should a criminal investigation begin, the prosecution‚s investigators would look into possible violations by both sides. Israel has made clear that it will not cooperate with the court, making it unlikely that senior Israeli officials will easily come before the court.Lawyers appearing with the Palestinian delegation at the court on Tuesday, however, told reporters that the institution does have jurisdiction in the Palestinian territories, and can therefore immediately begin investigating charges relating to settlement construction and deportations.Some countries in Europe ‚ the Palestinians‚ biggest financial donor ‚ have long discouraged a referral to the international body, fearing that it will become inextricably enmeshed in a quagmire to the detriment of its other work.",Palestinians Ask I.C.C. to Open Full Inquiry Into Israel,"May 22, 2018 /  9:30 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-icct-israel-palestinians/palestinians-demand-full-investigation-into-israel-at-hague-court-idUSKCN1IN11M,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki asked prosecutors at the International Criminal Court on Tuesday to launch a full investigation into accusations of Israeli human rights abuses on Palestinian territory, saying the evidence was “insurmountable”.

The court’s prosecutors launched an initial investigation into allegations against Israel when the Palestinians first joined the court in 2015. Tuesday’s referral allows that probe to proceed to the next stage of a full investigation, without waiting for a judge to give approval. Slideshow (3 Images)“A referral... does not automatically lead to the opening of an investigation,” chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a statement. “There should be no doubt that in this and any other situation currently before my office, I will always take the decision warranted by my mandate.” “REAL EFFECT” Harvard legal expert Alex Whiting, a former ICC prosecutor, said on Twitter that the referral “has a real effect. ..it is much harder for the office of the prosecutor to stay in the preliminary investigation phase for years”. Maliki said the request would give prosecutors the authority to investigate alleged crimes starting in 2014 and beyond, including last week’s deaths during protests in Gaza. “We believe there is ample and insurmountable evidence to that effect and we believe that proceeding with an investigation is the right and needed course of action,” he said. “Through judicial referral we want... the office of the prosecutor to open without delay an investigation into all crimes,” he told journalists.

5609850,773,['2018-05-23t12:19:15.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/books/philip-roth-apprasial.html,"One might as well come out and say it: The death of Philip Roth marks, in its way, the end of a cultural era as definitively as the death of Pablo Picasso did in 1973.Roth, who died Tuesday evening at 85, was the last front-rank survivor of a generation of fecund and authoritative and, yes, white and male novelists ‚ the others included John Updike, Norman Mailer and Saul Bellow ‚ who helped define American experience in the second half of the 20th century.Updike had more sheer talent, Bellow more moxie. But it became increasingly apparent in the late stage of Roth‚s career ‚ as he turned on the afterburners, writing 11 novels, several of them masterpieces, between 1995 and 2010 ‚ that he was leaving his cohort behind.When one considers the dimensions of Roth‚s late streak, it‚s hard not to recall a moment in ‚The Human Stain,‚ his 2000 novel, in which his longtime fictional stand-in, Nathan Zuckerman, goes to Tanglewood one Saturday morning to hear an open rehearsal. Music has replaced sex as the great pleasure of the aging Zuckerman‚s life. As he listens to a ‚sturdy little barrel of an unshaven Russian Jew‚ play the piano, he reports: ‚When he‚s finished, I thought, they‚ll have to throw the thing out. He crushes it. He doesn‚t let that piano conceal a thing. Whatever‚s in there is going to come out, and come out with its hands in the air.‚Roth did a similar kind of crushing and revealing. His work had more rage, more wit, more lust, more talk, more crosscurrents of thought and emotion, more turning over of the universals of existence (in his case, Jewish-American existence), as if tending meat over a fire, than any writer of his time.He was a born spellbinder, a man guided by voices. ‚I‚m an ecouteur ‚ an audiophiliac. I‚m a talk fetishist,‚ says the protagonist of his 1990 novel ‚Deception.‚ Roth was a kind of roiling ecouteur as well.He became famous as a young man because of the scandal that surrounded his fourth book, ‚Portnoy‚s Complaint‚ (1969), in which he put his pent-up hero on a psychiatrist‚s couch and allowed him to blissfully rant.Alexander Portnoy confessed most famously the amorous attention he paid to a piece of raw liver, ‚bought one afternoon at a butcher shop and, believe it or not, violated behind a billboard on the way to a bar mitzvah lesson.‚ There was so much onanism in the novel (‚I am the Raskolnikov of jerking off ‚ the sticky evidence is everywhere!‚) that the writer Jacqueline Susann said on ‚The Tonight Show‚ that she‚d love to meet Roth but did not want to shake his hand.Roth, who never won the Nobel Prize many predicted for him, once said, ‚I wonder if I had called ‚Portnoy‚s Complaint‚ ‚The Orgasm Under Rapacious Capitalism,‚ if I would thereby have earned the favor of the Swedish Academy.‚Below the humane comedy that filled much of Roth‚s work, and the sense of a longing to both transcend and embrace his lower-middle-class Jewish origins (Roth grew up in Newark‚s Weequahic neighborhood), he wrote with enormous insight about bedrock things like one‚s relationship with one‚s mother and father.Zuckerman, his alter ego, referred to his mother in ‚The Anatomy Lesson‚ (1983), in a typically poised phrase, as ‚a breast, then a lap, then a fading voice calling after him, ‚Be careful.‚‚About such women‚s husbands, he wrote in ‚American Pastoral‚ (1997):‚Mr. Levov was one of those slum-reared Jewish fathers whose rough-hewn, undereducated perspective goaded a whole generation of striving, college-educated Jewish sons: a father for whom everything is an unshakable duty, for whom there is a right way and a wrong way and nothing in between, a father whose compound of ambitions, biases and beliefs is so unruffled by careful thinking that he isn‚t as easy to escape from as he seems. Limited men with limitless energy; men quick to be friendly and quick to be fed up; men for whom the most serious thing in life is to keep going despite everything. And we were their sons. It was our job to love them.‚‚American Pastoral,‚ which won a Pulitzer Prize, may be the most realized of Roth‚s novels. Among other things, the ability he displays in it to write about children, while having had none of his own, is nothing short of mind-shaking.For certain other readers, his greatest novel may be the vastly darker ‚Sabbath‚s Theater‚ (1995), about an aging and priapic ex-puppeteer. Lust and shame were the driving forces behind much of Roth‚s fiction. In sex, too, talk was central to appeal. Roth wrote about the joys of both ‚phonetic seduction‚ and ‚a finely calibrated relative clause.‚ Roth has his perceptive feminist critics. Lionel Shriver told an interviewer that his female characters ‚are not nearly as filled out as his male ones; sometimes his women amount to little more than bodies or, when ex-wives, walking mistakes.‚Elizabeth Hardwick wrote: ‚The novels are prickled like a sea urchin with the spines and fuzz of many indecencies.‚ Vivian Gornick was more forceful: ‚If in Bellow misogyny was like seeping bile, in Roth it was lava pouring forth from a volcano.‚In an interview earlier this year with Charles McGrath in The New York Times, Roth replied that he had tried to be uncompromising in his portraits of ‚a small coterie of unsettled men,‚ even when ‚these have not been in harmony with the portrayal that a masculine public-relations campaign ‚ if there were such a thing ‚ might prefer.‚The best book on this novelist ‚ its title is ‚Roth Unbound: A Writer and His Books‚ (2013) ‚ was composed by a woman, Claudia Roth Pierpont (no relation). It‚s a sensitive, probing and uncommonly wise volume that will send you back into Roth‚s work with fresh eyes and wits.Pierpont processes and never easily explains away the dark impulses of a man who once wrote, ‚For a pure sense of being tumultuously alive, you can‚t beat the nasty side of existence.‚After sex, mortality was perhaps Roth‚s great subject. ‚Old age isn‚t a battle,‚ he wrote in ‚Everyman‚ (2006). ‚Old age is a massacre.‚ He wasn‚t afraid of what his obituarists might say of him. But he was aware that they would unearth some of the harsher notices of his work and pluck quotes from them. You could hear his comic tone as he told Pierpont, ‚Even in death, you get a bad review!‚Roth‚s output was protean, too wide, too deep and too fervent to truly capture in an appraisal of this length, composed overnight after learning of his death late the previous evening. But grief is not too strong a word to use to capture my emotions, and those of many others who kept pace with his work.This archwizard‚s books continue to be here. None are bad. The best still eat into the mind like acid.","Philip Roth, a Born Spellbinder and Peerless Chronicler of Sex and Death","May 23, 2018 /  3:49 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-philiproth/pulitzer-winning-author-philip-roth-dies-at-85-says-agent-idUSKCN1IO0CM,"(Reuters) - Author Philip Roth, who was both hailed and derided for laying bare the neuroses and obsessions that haunted the modern Jewish-American experience, died on Tuesday at the age of 85, his agent said.  Roth died in New York City at 10:30 p.m. local time of congestive heart failure, his literary agent Andrew Wylie said. Roth wrote more than 30 books, including the 1991 memoir “Patrimony,” which examined his complex relationship with his father and won the National Book Critics Circle Award. In his later years, Roth turned to the existential and sexual crises of middle age, never abandoning his commitment to exploring shame, embarrassment and other guilty secrets of the self, although usually with a heavy dose of humor. After more than 50 years as a writer, Roth decided that 2010’s “Nemesis,” the story of a polio epidemic in the Newark, New Jersey, neighborhood where he grew up, would be his last novel. He then went back and reread all his works “to see whether I’d wasted my time,” he said in a 2014 interview published in the New York Times Book Review.  For his conclusion, he quoted Joe Louis, the heavyweight boxing champion of the 1930s and ‘40s: “I did the best I could with what I had.” In 2017, he published “Why Write?,” a collection of essays and non-fiction works written between 1960 and 2013. Roth’s best-known work was the 1969 novel “Portnoy’s Complaint,” a first-person narrative about Alexander Portnoy, a young middle-class Jewish New Yorker. The book featured several notorious masturbation scenes and a narrator who declared he wanted to “put the id back in yid.” Roth’s first published book was the 1959 novella and short-story collection “Goodbye, Columbus,” which won the National Book Award. Several of his novels, including “Zuckerman Unbound,” “The Ghost Writer” and “The Anatomy Lesson”, feature Nathan Zuckerman, a character who came to be seen as Roth’s fictional alter ego. Roth liked to play with the distinctions between fact and fiction, often writing about neurotic novelists and even naming some characters “Philip.” Yet he was frequently annoyed and amused by readers’ desire to project the real Roth onto his characters. Although his novels often explored the Jewish experience in America, Roth, who said he was an atheist, rejected being labeled a Jewish-American writer. “It’s not a question that interests me. I know exactly what it means to be Jewish and it’s really not interesting,” he told the Guardian newspaper in 2005. “I’m an American.” Some critics said Roth’s novels exposed him as a self-hating Jew who played on negative stereotypes or generally cast Jews in a bad light. He would recall the hostile reception at a symposium at New York’s Yeshiva University in 1962 as the “most bruising public exchange of my life.” FILE PHOTO - Author Philip Roth poses in New York September 15, 2010.  REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File PhotoMULTIPLE HONORS Roth won the Pulitzer Prize for 1997’s “American Pastoral,” which examined the impact of the 1960s on a New Jersey family. He was the first three-time winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award, honored for “Operation Shylock” in 1994, “The Human Stain” in 2001 and “Everyman” in 2007. Roth also received the National Medal of Arts at the White House in 1998. Philip Milton Roth was born on March 19, 1933, in Newark, New Jersey. The son of an insurance salesman, Roth earned a bachelor’s degree at Bucknell University and a master’s degree in English from the University of Chicago. He dropped out of the doctoral program in 1959 to write film reviews for the New Republic before “Goodbye, Columbus” came out. Roth taught comparative literature, mostly at the University of Pennsylvania. He retired from teaching in 1992 as a distinguished professor of literature at New York’s Hunter College. Roth had a long relationship with British actress Claire Bloom but their five-year marriage ended in divorce in 1995. A year later, she published a bruising memoir, “Leaving a Doll’s House,” in which she portrayed him as depressed, remote, self-centered and verbally abusive. Roth had been especially prolific in the years leading to his 2012 retirement from writing, turning out novels nearly every two years. His more recent books included 2001’s “The Dying Animal” and “The Human Stain,” published in 2000 and released in 2003 as a movie starring Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman. “The Plot Against America,” published in 2004, imagines what would have happened had flying ace Charles Lindbergh, an isolationist who expressed anti-Semitic views, defeated Franklin Roosevelt in the 1940 election and signed a peace accord with Adolf Hitler. Following the death of several friends, including novelist Saul Bellow in 2005, Roth wrote “Everyman,” a short work of fiction about the physical decline and death of a successful advertising executive. Roth was considered a difficult interview subject and told the Guardian he disliked discussing his books. “You should let people fight with the books on their own and rediscover what they are and what they are not.” Roth said the act of writing for him is “filled with fear and loneliness and anxiety.” But, he added: “There are some days that compensate completely. In my life I have had, in total, a couple of months of these completely wonderful days as a writer, and that is enough.” In a New York Times interview in 2018, Roth reflected on his 50-plus years as a writer, describing it as: “Exhilaration and groaning. Frustration and freedom. Inspiration and uncertainty. Abundance and emptiness. Blazing forth and muddling through.” Slideshow (2 Images)(This story corrects spelling of Louis’s surname in 6th paragraph and Bucknell in 15th paragraph.)

REUTERS/Rebecca Cook  Aecon’s takeover by overseas investment and financing arm of China Communications Construction Co Ltd (601800.SS) was scheduled to close in February. But this was delayed after Canada extended a national security review. Aecon, which has helped build Canadian landmarks including the CN Tower and the Saint Lawrence Seaway, saw its shares tumble 15 percent to a 10-month low on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday. The Canadian government has now ordered CCCC International Holding Ltd not to implement the proposed investment to protect national security, Canadian Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our government is open to international investment that creates jobs and increases prosperity, but not at the expense of national security,” Bains said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said earlier his government would closely monitor security issues when it decided whether to allow the deal, examining the implications for intellectual property protections. Related CoverageChina urges level playing field after Canada blocks company takeoverChina's CCCC says has not received notification of Aecon deal rejection from CanadaChina’s foreign ministry said it hoped Canada could “abandon its prejudices” and provide a level playing field for Chinese enterprises in response to a question about the Aecon deal. “In principle, China always opposes the politicization of this kind of trade and investment activity and we oppose the mistaken method of carrying out political interference on the basis of so-called national security reasons,” ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Thursday. Aecon said it was disappointed with the government’s decision and was no longer pursuing a sale process. “We believe ... uncertainty around the company’s future strategic direction, particularly with a CEO search underway, is likely to weigh on share prices substantially,” AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray said. An executive from CCCC’s investor relations team in Beijing told Reuters the company had yet to receive relevant documents from the Canadian government. Ottawa’s move comes as Canada is in exploratory trade talks with China as the country seeks to diversify its export markets.  Chinese interests in overseas assets has worried governments elsewhere such as in Denmark, whose officials have expressed concern over Greenland courting Chinese firms, including CCCC, to expand three airports. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes foreign purchases of U.S. assets to protect national security interests, has also been tightening scrutiny of Chinese companies’ acquisitions of American firms. Earlier this month, Chinese conglomerate HNA Group dropped its bid for most of SkyBridge Capital. In January, Ant Financial’s plan to acquire U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International collapsed after CFIUS rejected it over national security concerns. U.S. President Donald Trump has also blocked microchip maker Broadcom’s (AVGO.O) $117 billion bid to buy Qualcomm (QCOM.O) on national security grounds, ending what would have been the technology industry’s biggest deal ever amid concerns that it would give China the upper hand in mobile communications.

Lawrence Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation called the proposal ‚a significant positive development for the industry that will allow members to reduce costs and compete in the global marketplace more effectively, all while not in any way hindering national security.‚But critics of the proposal worry that American guns, including AR-15s and similar semiautomatic rifles frequently used in mass shootings, could more easily find their way into the hands of foreign criminals. Among the reasons: a change in the disclosure rules for certain sales. The State Department is required by the Arms Export Control Act to submit any commercial arms sale worth $1 million or more to congressional review. The Commerce Department has no equivalent mandate.Representative Norma J. Torres, Democrat of California, has introduced legislation to keep oversight with the State Department, calling the proposed shift ‚dangerous.‚‚It is very likely that the administration‚s plan could be a boon for illegal weapons traffickers and their unsavory customers ‚ from ISIS to Mexico‚s Sinaloa Cartel,‚ she wrote in a description of her bill.The proposed changes are meant to keep only items that are ‚inherently for military end use‚ under State Department control, and move those that are ‚widely available in retail outlets‚ to the Commerce Department. Export sales represent a small share of the domestic gun industry. Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands, which owns the Smith & Wesson label, both generate less than 5 percent of their sales outside the United States.Guns imports far surpass exports in the United States. In 2015, the most recent year available from the Justice Department, 5.1 million firearms were imported into the United States, and 343,456 firearms were exported.The shooting sports foundation predicts that revising the process would increase firearms exports by as much as 20 percent, Mr. Keane said.But other experts pointed out that demand in some countries is constrained by strict gun-control regulations. And competition from brands like Italy‚s Beretta, Austria‚s Glock and Germany‚s Heckler & Koch could dampen enthusiasm for American entrants.Jurgen Brauer, the chief economist of the Small Arms Analytics research group, said he predicted loosened export rules would result in perhaps a 2 percent increase in sales for American gunmakers.‚I don‚t see a competitive advantage for U.S. manufactured arms abroad,‚ he said. ‚Looking purely at quality, reliability, reputation and price point, what is it that these manufacturers see to make them believe a U.S. weapon would stand out in the foreign market?‚Firearm sales in the United States have struggled since President Trump, a vocal supporter of the gun industry, was elected. Fears of gun control, which helped propel demand to record highs during the Obama administration, have waned during Mr. Trump‚s tenure. It was under Mr. Obama‚s watch that the effort to turn the administration of commercial firearms export licenses to the Commerce Department began. The proposed rule concerning guns was nearly complete when 26 people, most of them children, were shot and killed in Newtown, Conn., in late 2012.Kevin Wolf, an assistant secretary of Commerce who was leading the development of the new export rules at the time, said he had decided to hold off on publication because of the tragedy.‚Even though these rules have literally absolutely nothing to do with domestic gun control, I didn‚t think it was optically the right time to start discussing guns,‚ he said. ‚I knew it was going to be a very emotional topic.‚The firearms rule currently being proposed ‚looks 95 percent identical‚ to the 2012 version, Mr. Wolf said.‚This is an intensely bureaucratic exercise,‚ he said. ‚It‚s not a major change in gun policy.‚The Commerce Department already oversees exports of certain shotguns, and the proposed rule adds ‚guns you can buy at a commercial gun distributor,‚ Mr. Wolf said.However, not all the items that would be covered by the looser Commerce Department rules are available everywhere in the United States. California ‚ one of the country‚s largest states for firearms sales ‚ heavily regulates two items in particular: .5o-caliber rifles and detachable magazines of the kind typically used by the military and police departments.The proposed changes would establish the benchmark for so-called high-capacity magazines as those capable of holding more than 50 rounds. California restricts most civilian residents to owning magazines that hold just 10 rounds; 30-round magazines, which are frequently used by the military, could be sold abroad. Similarly, California places tight restrictions on owning powerful .50-caliber rifles, which are capable of hitting human-size targets at a range of 2,000 yards. The state Legislature called them a ‚clear and present terrorist threat‚ to not only human life, but also vehicles and infrastructure.Representative Elizabeth Esty, whose Connecticut district includes Newtown, said on Wednesday that she would try to ‚stop this if I can.‚‚This is a national security and diplomacy question, but moving it to Commerce makes it an economic promotion of an industry,‚ she said. ‚It‚s putting profits ahead of people.‚","A Bid to Increase Gun Exports, Stalled After Sandy Hook, Moves Ahead","May 22, 2018 /  7:49 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-guns/trump-administration-to-publish-proposed-rule-changes-for-gun-exports-official-idUSKCN1IN2S7,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is preparing to publish on Thursday long-delayed proposed rule changes for the export of U.S. firearms, a State Department official said on Tuesday.  FILE PHOTO - Rifles are seen at the Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc. gun factory in Newport, New Hampshire January 6, 2012.  REUTERS/Eric Thayer The rule changes would move the oversight of commercial firearm exports from the U.S. Department of State to the Department of Commerce.     The action is part of a broader Trump administration overhaul of weapons export policy that was announced in April. Timing for the formal publication of the rule change and the opening of the public comment period was unveiled by Mike Miller the acting secretary for the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, the State Department’s body that currently oversees the bulk of commercial firearms transfers and other foreign military sales. He was speaking at the Forum on the Arms Trade’s annual conference at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank.  Reuters first reported on the proposed rule changes in September as the Trump administration was preparing to make it easier for American gun makers to sell small arms, including assault rifles and ammunition, to foreign buyers. Domestic gun sales have fallen significantly after soaring under President Barack Obama, when gun enthusiasts stockpiled weapons and ammunition out of fear that the government would tighten gun laws. A move by the Trump administration to make it simpler to sell small arms abroad may generate business for gun makers American Outdoor Brands (AOBC.O) and Sturm Ruger & Company (RGR.N) in an industry experiencing a deep sales slump since the election of President Donald Trump. Remington, America’s oldest gun maker, filed for bankruptcy protection in March, weeks after a shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 people and triggered intensified campaigns for gun control by activists. Remington emerged from bankruptcy last week. The expected relaxing of rules could increase foreign gun sales by as much as 20 percent, the National Sports Shooting Foundation has estimated. As well as the industry’s big players, it may also help small gunsmiths and specialists who are currently required to pay an annual federal fee to export relatively minor amounts of products.

5774225,780,['2018-05-23t18:02:45.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/climate/rice-global-warming.html,"WASHINGTON ‚ When scientists want to figure out how climate change might disrupt the world‚s food supplies, they often explore how rising temperatures could shift growing seasons or how more frequent droughts could damage harvests.In recent years, though, researchers have begun to realize that the extra carbon dioxide that humanity is pumping into the atmosphere isn‚t just warming the planet, it‚s also making some of our most important crops less nutritious by changing their chemical makeup and diluting vitamins and minerals.Now, a new study has found that rice exposed to elevated levels of carbon dioxide contains lower amounts of several important nutrients.The potential health consequences are large, given that there are already billions of people around the world who don‚t get enough protein, vitamins or other nutrients in their daily diet. ‚When we study food security, we‚ve often focused on how climate change might affect the production of crops,‚ said Lewis H. Ziska, a plant physiologist at the United States Department of Agriculture and a co-author of the new study. ‚But the quality of those crops and their nutritional content can be just as important, and that hasn‚t always gotten the close scrutiny it deserves.‚In the study, published Wednesday in Science Advances, Dr. Ziska and his colleagues exposed experimental rice fields in China and Japan to the same elevated levels of carbon dioxide that are expected to occur worldwide later this century as a result of fossil-fuel burning and other human activities.Most of the 18 varieties of rice that were grown and harvested contained significantly less protein, iron and zinc than rice that is grown today. All of the rice varieties saw dramatic declines in vitamins B1, B2, B5 and B9, though they contained higher levels of vitamin E. The researchers focused on rice because more than 2 billion people worldwide rely on it as a primary food source.For people in wealthy countries who enjoy a diverse, healthy diet, it may not matter much if rice becomes less nutritious in the years ahead. ‚But in a country like Bangladesh, rice provides 70 percent of the calories and there aren‚t a lot of other opportunities to get those nutrients,‚ said Kristie L. Ebi, a professor of public health at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study. This newest paper builds on a major study published in Nature in 2014, finding that elevated levels of carbon dioxide reduced the amount of zinc and iron found in wheat, rice, field peas and soybeans. In both studies, researchers installed pipes that emitted carbon dioxide onto small open-air plots ‚ rather than simply testing crops in enclosed greenhouses ‚ to simulate future real-world conditions.The finding that extra carbon dioxide can make crops less nutritious may sound counterintuitive. Plants, after all, rely on carbon dioxide as an ingredient for photosynthesis, so it seems like more CO2 should be beneficial, helping them grow. But what scientists have also found is that the chemical composition of a plant depends on the balance of the carbon dioxide it takes in from the air and the nutrients it absorbs from the soil. Upset this balance, and the plant can change in unexpected ways.In plants like rice and wheat that undergo what is known as C3 photosynthesis, higher levels of carbon dioxide may spur plants to produce more carbohydrates, which dilute some of the more nutritious components. But scientists are still trying to understand exactly why some compounds, like vitamin B, get diluted and others don‚t, or why some varieties of rice see sharper declines in vitamin B than others.With further research, scientists might try to breed or genetically engineer new crop varieties that preserve much of their nutritional value in the face of rising carbon dioxide. But this could prove challenging, Dr. Ziska said, given that all of the tested rice lines in their study showed significant declines in vitamin B. ‚We still don‚t understand why some plant genotypes show a bigger response to higher levels of carbon dioxide,‚ said Andrew Leakey, a crop biologist at the University of Illinois who was not involved in the latest study. ‚And that‚s important if we want to move from understanding the problem to solving it.‚ If crop scientists can‚t solve the problem, larger changes may be needed to blunt the negative effect on nutrition worldwide. ‚The bottom line is that people will need more diverse diets with a range of quality food sources,‚ Dr. Ebi said. ‚That‚s already a major challenge.‚ Another possible solution would be to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that humanity emits. Currently, levels of CO2 in the atmosphere average around 410 parts per million, up from 350 parts per million in the 1980s, largely from the burning of fossil fuels. In the rice study, the researchers looked at how crops responded to levels of around 580 parts per million, which could prove tough to avoid this century without drastic changes.Samuel S. Myers, a research scientist at the Harvard University Center for the Environment who worked on the 2014 Nature study, said that this latest paper underscored the need for more research on how our changing atmosphere will affect the wide variety of plants we rely on to feed ourselves. There has been no work done to date, for instance, on how crops planted in impoverished soils in Africa might respond to rising CO2 levels. And studies to date have focused on staple crops such as wheat and rice rather than fruits or vegetables. And, while Dr. Ziska has published a paper on how changes in plant protein content might affect bee colonies, little is known about how other parts of the food chain might be affected.‚The idea that food might become less nutritious was a surprise, it‚s not intuitive,‚ said Dr. Myers. ‚But I think we should continue to expect surprises. We are completely altering the biophysical conditions that underpin our food system, and we still have very little understanding of how those disruptions will ripple through ecosystems and affect human health.‚",How More Carbon Dioxide Can Make Food Less Nutritious,"June 7, 2018 /  4:04 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-carbon/scientists-say-cost-of-sucking-carbon-from-thin-air-could-tumble-idUSKCN1J325H,"OSLO (Reuters) - High costs of extracting greenhouse gases from thin air could tumble with new technologies that can help to combat climate change, scientists said on Thursday. Carbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy company, outlined the design of a large industrial plant that it said could capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a cost of between $94 and $232 a tonne. That is well below past estimates of about $600 a tonne by the American Physical Society, said David Keith, a Harvard University physics professor and the founder of Carbon Engineering who led the research. “I hope to show that this as a viable energy industrial technology, not something that is a magic bullet ... but something that is completely doable,” he told Reuters of the peer-reviewed study published in the journal Joule. Carbon Engineering, which has about 40 employees and produces about a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from an experimental plant. The technology makes synthetic fuels using only air, water and renewable power.  Keith said an industrial-scale plant could make fuel at a dollar a liter. That would be competitive in California, where low carbon fuel standards to cut pollution from cars and trucks mean high prices. He said some investors were interested. An industrial plant, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, could capture a million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, equivalent to emissions by 250,000 cars. Other experts welcomed the study as a step to clear up huge uncertainties about the costs of “direct air capture”. U.N. reports indicate that governments may have to deploy such novel technologies this century to remove carbon from nature and bury it to limit global warming under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. “Direct air capture is a politically promising route for carbon dioxide removal,” said Oliver Geden, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. And an air capture plant could be built almost anywhere. It would not threaten farmland, unlike options of planting vast forests which soak up carbon dioxide, he said. Climeworks, a Swiss company and Carbon Engineering’s main rival, also told Reuters it was hoping to cut its production price to $100 a tonne in the next 5-10 years, from about $600 now. It sells carbon dioxide to greenhouses as an airborne fertilizer to grow tomatoes or cucumbers. Jan Wurzbacher, a founder of Climeworks, said more and more governments are likely to jack up penalties on carbon emissions to limit floods, storms and rising seas in coming years, making the technology more viable.

REUTERS/Tom Mihalek/File PhotoThe legislation now goes to Governor Phil Murphy, who would have to sign it before operators could start taking sports wagers. He is not expected to sign it this week, according to his office. The bill contains none of the fraud-fighting measures requested by professional sports leagues, including real-time game data sharing with casinos and state regulators, as well as fees to the leagues to help pay for expanded monitoring and investigations. New Jersey and other states are racing for a piece of the estimated $150 billion spent on illegal annual wagers in the United States, after the top court in May overturned a 1992 law that had banned sports wagering except in a few places, including Las Vegas. More Americans now than ever, 69 percent, say gambling is morally acceptable, according to a Gallup poll released on Thursday. Delaware, which already had limited sports wagers, rolled out full-scale betting on Tuesday. In New Jersey, the U.S. unit of UK-based William Hill PLC has for years been preparing sports books at Monmouth Park Racetrack. In the state’s fiscally stressed gambling hub Atlantic City, William Hill also plans to operate a 7,500-square-foot, $6 million sports betting area at the twice-bankrupt former Revel Casino Hotel, which is now called the Ocean Resort Casino and is set to open later in June. London-listed gambling companies, facing tighter regulations and higher taxes in their home markets, are likely to seek expansion across the Atlantic, especially as sports betting is set to grow in the United States. The Dublin-based bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair agreed in May, after the U.S. high-court’s ruling, to merge its U.S. business with fantasy sports giant FanDuel. New Jersey itself is expected to pull in between $12 million and $17 million in the first full year of operation, according to legislative estimates.  That would be a tiny drop in the bucket for New Jersey’s proposed $37.4 billion budget for fiscal 2019, which is still being finalized. The projection is based on an assumption that 28 percent of the state’s population will bet on sports and on the 8.5 percent tax rate on gross revenues from in-person wagering. The state can also impose a 13 percent tax on internet sports bets, which could begin 30 days after the law goes into effect.

(Reuters) - With two $20 bets and a rambunctious crowd awaiting their turn, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy placed the state’s very first legal sports bets on Thursday, capping a years-long battle to end the ban on sports betting in the Garden State.”  This is a huge step forward for gaming, for the tracks, for the economy of this state,” Murphy said before placing his bets, with a crowd of media swarming him as he stepped to the counter at Monmouth Park Racetrack. Murphy’s wagers - that Germany will win the World Cup and the New Jersey Devils will take home hockey’s Stanley Cup next year - may not seem monumental. But the beginning of legal sports betting in New Jersey likely paves the way for much of the rest of the United States to eventually regulate and tax it. While sports betting is legal in many other countries, a 1992 U.S. law barred it in the United States except for a limited number of states, such as Nevada, where casinos have long included sports betting. New Jersey voters agreed in 2011 to change the state’s constitution to legalize sports betting, in part as an economic and revenue boost to the state’s ailing horse racetracks and gambling hub Atlantic City. State lawmakers quickly passed bills to legalize it, but professional sports leagues pushed back in court, arguing that it was illegal under the old federal law and that sports could be more easily corrupted due to increased money at stake. But in May, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with New Jersey and overturned the 1992 law. Now West Virginia, Connecticut, Mississippi and New York are looking to bring sports wagering out of the shadows, with other states are likely to follow.

Larry Cook, 47, was there to bet on baseball’s New York Yankees. He said he already likes to gamble in Atlantic City, and enjoys sports, so being able to wager on the sports he already watches is a perfect melding of two worlds. Plus, he appreciates that some of the betting money will make its way to his state, an unusual refrain from heavily taxed New Jerseyans. “If I’m gonna lose, at least it’s going to a good cause,” he said. He drove an hour to place his bet. But once sports betting launches at the Meadowlands Racetrack closer to home, he said he will go there instead. Joseph Correnti, 30, also drove an hour from his home the night before to stay with a friend nearby. He was among the first to place bets. Slideshow (10 Images)Clutching cash and a betting form, he too bet $20 on the Yankees to win Thursday’s game against the Tampa Bay Rays and another $20 that the New York Mets will prevail over the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Now it will see how sleeping in it goes.After nearly two years of hand-wringing, the league‚s 32 owners decided on Wednesday to overhaul N.F.L. policy on protocol for the national anthem. At their two-day meeting in Atlanta, the owners said that the league would allow players to stay in the locker room during the playing of ‚The Star-Spangled Banner,‚ but said that teams would be fined if players ‚do not stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem.‚ Then there is this hammer: Those teams can then punish players however they see fit.‚It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of N.F.L. players were unpatriotic,‚ Commissioner Roger Goodell said, explaining the need for the new policy. ‚We believe today‚s decision will keep our focus on the game and the extraordinary athletes who play it ‚ and on our fans who enjoy it.‚Yet the rule change figures to go a long way toward pleasing no one ‚ least of all the players. In a text message sent as the owners voted, George Atallah, assistant executive director for external affairs for the N.F.L. Players Association, made it clear the new rule was ‚not a compromise.‚‚We were not consulted or included,‚ he wrote.The league has set itself up to take criticism both from those who want it to require that all players stand for the national anthem ‚ including President Trump ‚ and those who feel the league is trying to silence players who have chosen that moment to protest social injustice. In a statement released after the vote, the players‚ union said, ‚The vote by the N.F.L. club C.E.O.s today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Chairman of the N.F.L.‚s Management Council, John Mara, about the principles, values and patriotism of our league.‚The new protocol also may lead to a host of challenges and recriminations if players decide to test the limits of the rules, and their owners‚ tolerance. Giving clubs the authority to punish players sets up a situation where players in Seattle or Philadelphia may have one set of workplace rules while those in Houston or Dallas may have another.For a league that likes to talk about unity, this rule creates a dynamic where some owners may fine players for not standing for the anthem, while others may be viewed as havens where players can speak their mind.The previous rule, written about a decade ago, was not perfect. It required that players be on the sideline during the playing of the anthem, and that they should ‚ not must ‚ stand.Few knew the rule even existed until Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, took advantage of that language in 2016 when he chose to kneel during the national anthem to draw attention to police brutality and other social injustice against African-Americans. When other players ‚ almost all of them black ‚ joined Kaepernick or staged their own silent protests, it created a rift that the owners have been trying to repair ever since. The league tried to sidestep the issue through the 2016 season, hoping the news media would begin to ignore the handful of protesting players and the demonstrations would fade. By the start of the last season, the number of players taking part had shrunk to just a dozen or so. But when President Trump called out the owners for letting even those few players continue to protest and used an epithet to describe the players who continued to make a stand, everything changed.For one Sunday last September, owners and executives stood arm-in-arm with the players. After that, protesting players began taking the blame for the decline in N.F.L. television ratings, the league‚s most-valued barometer.The league has only itself to blame. The N.F.L. has long used patriotism as a marketing tool. No big game would be complete without a military flyover or the unfurling of a flag as big as the field itself. Like many sports leagues, it wrapped itself even more tightly in the American flag after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.It has accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Department of Defense to stage tributes to members of the military at games. The government also paid for on-field color guards and ceremonies where soldiers enlisted or re-enlisted in front of thousands of fans.But it was not alone. Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and other sports leagues also took money to play host to patriotic displays (the N.F.L. paid back more than $700,000 to the Defense Department after an audit). The National Basketball Association has a longstanding policy that players must stand during the anthem. But the N.F.L. is by far the country‚s most popular sport, and the one most closely associated with the military.The anthem divide has caused a racial rift. About 70 percent of the league‚s players are black, roughly the same percentage of its fans who are white. Many black fans have said they support the players who are protesting, while many white fans have said those players are unpatriotic.These divisions are even more apparent in certain geographic areas. The owners of teams in states like Texas, which leans conservative and has a large military presence, have been among the most vocal in arguing that all players need to stand. Owners in states in the Northeast, or in Seattle and San Francisco, which are more progressive, have expressed more tolerance. The owners have tried to create a policy that allows for these differences. But in doing so, they may further highlight their problems. Coaches are always talking about the importance of players sticking together. Now they will be forced to decide whether to keep an entire team in the locker room to present a united front, or to let a handful of players stay in the locker room while their colleagues stand outside for the anthem.Also, what of the league‚s promise to donate millions of dollars to groups battling social injustice? The owners trumpeted that pledge late last year as a sign they were serious about supporting the players. Now they are telling the players that they could be fined for trying to highlight those same initiatives with their actions.Penalizing teams whose players do not respect the anthem figures to be even more troublesome. Who decides the requisite level of respect? Will owners pressure their players to stand on the sideline? Players are paying close attention to Kaepernick‚s grievance, which has accused the owners of conspiring to keep him out of the league because of his protests.Will owners only sign players who agree to stand for the anthem?To be fair, it‚s hard to envision the N.F.L. crafting a policy that satisfies everyone. But one that is likely to satisfy only the 32 owners hardly seems like an enlightened solution.",N.F.L. Anthem Policy Bound to Please Only the N.F.L.,"May 23, 2018 /  8:12 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-football-nfl-sf-nyj-owners-anthem/some-nfl-owners-ready-to-go-rogue-on-new-anthem-policy-idUSKCN1IO35Y,"Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL touted a new anthem policy in Atlanta on Wednesday, but signs of serious aftershocks were felt almost instantly.

Mandatory Credit: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports/File PhotoThe NFLPA lashed back against the league for creating a protocol that did not adhere to the collective bargaining agreement, nor did the NFL and its owners include players in conversation about the new policy demanding teams and its players stand if on the field for the Star-Spangled Banner. With that in mind, San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York said he abstained from an otherwise unanimous vote on the final day of the owner’s meetings. York said he felt players and officials should have direct input on the matter. In October, he said he supported players — including former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and safety Eric Reid — and their right to protest. “We encourage (players) to stand, but we’re not requiring you to do anything,” he said. “You can express yourself, but we want you to stand because you want to stand. ... And we want to make our country and our communities a better place — not because you’re forcing us to, but because we’re compelled to.” The NFL policy permits teams to choose to stay in the locker room during the national anthem, but calls for fines and punishment for any mode of disrespect. Steelers owner Art Rooney said that would include players holding a fist over their head and locking arms. Cowboys owner Stephen Jones said there is no fine schedule for anthem-related penalties and that owners will know disrespect “when we see it.” New York Jets chairman Christopher Johnson said in March a change in anthem protocol was uncalled for, but he did vote with the majority on Wednesday in the name of the good of the game. However, Johnson said Jets’ players are free to protest without fear of NFL or team fines. Johnson said if his players are fined, he will cover the cost. “I do not like imposing any club-specific rules,” Johnson told Newsday. “If somebody (on the Jets) takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players. I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer that they stand? Of course. But I understand if they felt the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that we’re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines. I don’t want to come down on them like a ton of bricks, and I won’t. There will be no club fines or suspensions or any sort of repercussions. If the team gets fined, that’s just something I’ll have to bear.” Johnson plans to huddle with players at his first opportunity. “Even without those fines, this is going to be tough on the players, and I want a chance to speak with the coaches and other players to get feedback on this policy and to build on the good work and momentum that we have built up on these issues of social justice, on legislation, and all the things that we can do,” he said. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Some NFL owners ready to go rogue on new anthem policy,W

Almost immediately after passage, questions arose about how it would be enforced.The policy is an attempt to find a middle ground on a divisive issue that has shaken the country‚s most successful sport for nearly two years, beginning when the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem to protest police violence against minorities and economic inequality. President Trump escalated the issue a year later as he attacked kneeling players as unpatriotic, a stand that is believed to have contributed to a decline in television ratings.[Ken Belson writes ‚the N.F.L.‚s new anthem policy is bound to please only the N.F.L.‚]Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., said the protests, which began in the summer of 2016, created a ‚false perception among many that thousands of N.F.L. players were unpatriotic.‚ He added, ‚The new policy will keep our focus on the game and the extraordinary athletes who play it ‚ and on our fans who enjoy it.‚ But if the N.F.L. had hoped to quiet the debate, instead people on opposite sides appeared to dig in further after Wednesday‚s announcement.Trump said he was pleased with the N.F.L.‚s new policy, but said he did not think the players should even be staying in the locker room in protest.If a player is not standing for the national anthem, Mr. Trump said, ‚Maybe you shouldn‚t be in the country.‚The president‚s comments, recorded Wednesday, were aired Thursday morning on ‚Fox & Friends.‚Vice President Mike Pence reacted Wednesday with a one-word tweet, ‚#Winning,‚ which included a picture of a CNN article about the news. In a strongly worded statement issued just minutes after the N.F.L.‚s announcement, the N.F.L. Players Association said the league had not consulted the players‚ union in creating the new protocol and accused league officials of hypocrisy. ‚The vote by N.F.L. club C.E.O.s today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Chairman of the N.F.L.‚s Management Council John Mara about the principles, values and patriotism of our League,‚ the statement said. George Atallah, the union‚s assistant executive director for external affairs, said the new rules were ‚not a compromise.‚ The players‚ union said it would challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement.Malcolm Jenkins became a leader of a group of socially active players known as the Players Coalition after having raised his fist in protest during the anthem last season. He said the league had acted to silence the players.‚What N.F.L. owners did today was thwart the players‚ constitutional rights to express themselves and use our platform to draw attention to social injustices like racial inequality in our country,‚ Mr. Jenkins said in a statement. ‚Everyone loses when voices get stifled.‚Chris Long, a defensive end for the Philadelphia Eagles, was among the players who disagreed with the new policy, saying the league continued ‚to fall short on this issue.‚‚This is a fear of a diminished bottom line,‚ he wrote on Twitter. ‚It‚s also fear of a president turning his base against a corporation. This is not patriotism. Don‚t get it confused. These owners don‚t love America more than the players demonstrating and taking real action to improve it.‚ Mr. Goodell has struggled to handle the controversy over the player protests during the national anthem ever since Mr. Kaepernick began his demonstrations. Mr. Kaepernick remains unemployed and has filed a grievance accusing team owners of colluding to keep him out of football.Veterans groups complained and organized boycotts, signing up sympathetic fans to refuse to watch N.F.L. games until players faced repercussions, while social justice activists held up Mr. Kaepernick and others who demonstrated as symbols of newly engaged 21st century sports heroes.Yet even with emotions running hot on both sides, the controversy had largely quieted by the beginning of last season, when only a dozen or so players were still kneeling or raising a fist during the anthem. Then, at a rally on a Friday night in Alabama in September, Mr. Trump moved the debate back to the fore, rousing the crowd by imploring N.F.L. owners to fire any player who refused to stand and referring to protesting players using an epithet.He then took to Twitter: ‚Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their national anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!‚ Weeks later, Mr. Pence staged a planned walkout at an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis when members of the 49ers knelt during the anthem.The debate has shaken the league in part because it has affected the metric that is most important to it: television ratings. Audiences for N.F.L. games are off about 20 percent from two seasons ago. While it is impossible to know how much of that is a result of fans being turned off by the protests during the anthem, industry experts, including Sean McManus, chief executive of CBS Sports, one of the league‚s media partners, have said data show the N.F.L.‚s handling of the issue is at least partly to blame for the drop-off. The debate has even divided the league geographically, with teams in more progressive regions offering support to players who chose to demonstrate and those in more conservative regions pushing for new rules to punish the on-field protests.N.F.L. owners, players and executives met in October to discuss the anthem issue. According to an audio recording obtained by The New York Times, players wanted to talk about Mr. Kaepernick‚s case, while owners were more concerned about how to avoid negative publicity around the issue of kneeling during the anthem.‚The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don‚t feel is in the best interests of America,‚ said Robert K. Kraft, the Patriots owner and a longtime supporter of Trump‚s. ‚It‚s divisive and it‚s horrible.‚The Houston Texans owner Bob McNair told players they should talk to their teammates who kneel: ‚You fellas need to ask your compadres, fellas, stop that other business, let‚s go out and do something that really produces positive results, and we‚ll help you.‚Whether the new policy further inflames or assuages the controversy remains to be seen.Players had previously been required to be on the field for the anthem. Now every player who does take the field will have to ‚show respect for the flag and the anthem.‚ The league will fine the teams that have any players it decides have not done so, though it did not specify what would qualify as disrespect. Borrowing from the former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart‚s definition of pornography, Stephen Jones, son of the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, said the league would know disrespect when it saw it.The Steelers owner Art Rooney said after the vote that raising a fist or linking arms during the anthem, as some players have done, would be considered disrespectful.Jed York of the 49ers abstained in the vote, according to NFL Media‚s Jim Trotter, a move that 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman said carried great respect with the players. Christopher Johnson, the chairman and chief executive of the Jets, said the team would not punish players who chose to kneel during the anthem, despite the cost.‚There will be no club fines or suspensions or any sort of repercussions,‚ Johnson told Newsday. ‚If the team gets fined, that‚s just something I‚ll have to bear.‚Any decision not to punish the players may further incur the wrath of the veterans‚ groups that have pushed for the N.F.L. to address the issue.Denise H. Rohan, leader of the American Legion, the nation‚s largest veterans‚ organization, commended the N.F.L. for trying to end what the groups have portrayed as visible attacks on cherished symbols of the country, even though players have long denied they were creating anything of the sort.‚While the issues that led to the controversy remain and deserve continued national dialogue, we hope that all Americans would stand united as one under our national symbol,‚ Ms. Rohan said, adding that the new policy ‚is a fair compromise for all involved.‚The American Civil Liberties Union‚s deputy legal director, Jeff Robinson, issued a statement calling the policy a crude undermining of national principles: ‚Protest isn‚t supposed to be comfortable. It‚s not supposed to happen in the shadows. It‚s supposed to disrupt. Patriotism is demanding America uphold the ideals it was founded on: equality and justice for all. Patriotism is pledging allegiance to democratic values, not to symbols or songs. Patriotism is dissent.‚Jarrett Stepman, a writer and editor at The Daily Signal, a right-leaning Heritage Foundation publication, said the new policy did not resolve the underlying issue.‚They have certainly tuned out a lot of fans who were very loyal, who felt the league was very unpatriotic, was doing bad by them,‚ he said. ‚I don‚t think a lot of these fans are going to come back.‚",Trump Supports N.F.L.‚Äôs New National Anthem Policy,"May 23, 2018 /  8:12 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-football-nfl-sf-nyj-owners-anthem/some-nfl-owners-ready-to-go-rogue-on-new-anthem-policy-idUSKCN1IO35Y,"Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL touted a new anthem policy in Atlanta on Wednesday, but signs of serious aftershocks were felt almost instantly.

With that in mind, San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York said he abstained from an otherwise unanimous vote on the final day of the owner’s meetings. York said he felt players and officials should have direct input on the matter. In October, he said he supported players — including former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and safety Eric Reid — and their right to protest. “We encourage (players) to stand, but we’re not requiring you to do anything,” he said. “You can express yourself, but we want you to stand because you want to stand. ...

The cap, which was included in last year‚s $1.5 trillion Republican tax overhaul, hit predominantly Democratic, high-tax states hardest since it limits the amount of state and local sales, income and property taxes that residents can deduct from their federal taxes.That has prompted a scramble among local lawmakers to find ways to allow constituents who owe more than $10,000 to continue to fully deduct those taxes and avoid a tax increase.The I.R.S. said it would not tolerate states that try to flout the law ‚ a stance that is likely to be challenged in court. ‚Despite these state efforts to circumvent the new statutory limitation on state and local tax deductions, taxpayers should be mindful that federal law controls the proper characterization of payments for federal income tax purposes,‚ the I.R.S. wrote in a notice released on Wednesday.The I.R.S. notice, which is a precursor to a formal guidance that will need to go through a review process, drew swift condemnation from state lawmakers.‚New York was the first to take action to protect our residents from this hostile assault and ensure New York families weren‚t being used as a piggy bank to pay for tax cuts for big corporations,‚ Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, said. ‚Now, the administration appears poised to attack again through new tax regulations, showing its true hostility to New Yorkers and middle-class taxpayers.‚New York recently began allowing taxpayers to convert local property taxes into charitable contributions, which are fully deductible from federal taxes. Other states, like New Jersey and Connecticut, have been moving forward with similar plans to reclassify state taxes as charitable contributions. New York is also establishing a new system that allows taxpayers to convert their state income tax to a payroll tax, which companies would pay on their behalf and then deduct from their federal tax bill.While Wednesday‚s notice is focused on the charitable deduction scheme, a senior Treasury official said the department was planning to roll out more I.R.S. notices dealing with other potential loopholes in the tax law. The notice, the official said, was intended to serve as a broad warning to states to avoid developing more ‚gimmicks.‚ Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, a Democrat, said he was certain the state‚s legislation was lawful and that the I.R.S. was putting politics over policy. He said the federal government‚s policy on charitable deductions has become inconsistent, which could open it to legal challenges.‚For the federal government to permit certain states to allow for charitable deductions, but not others that are following the same principles, is unconscionable,‚ Mr. Murphy said. ‚I remain committed to fighting the SALT deduction tax cap and am confident that the solution signed into law can and should be embraced by the I.R.S.‚While the I.R.S. notice was intended to formally explain where the federal government stands on the issue, the ensuing fight might make the situation all the murkier.Richard LaBarbiera, the mayor of Paramus, N.J., and one of the early supporters of New Jersey‚s attempt to help taxpayers, said the I.R.S. notice could help states get clarity on what is allowed under the new law.‚The thing that I had reservations about was asking or offering this program to the residents with the uncertainty when they go file their taxes what the I.R.S. was going to say,‚ he said. ‚I‚d rather see this decided in advance before we accept a single dollar.‚Last year, residents in many states tried to prepay their 2018 property taxes before the new law took effect, but the I.R.S. took action to limit that option.Efforts to restrict the state and local tax deduction were controversial and prompted several Republican lawmakers from high-tax states to vote against the tax bill. The $10,000 cap was imposed as a way to offset some of the cost of other individual and business tax cuts. The Treasury Department and the I.R.S. are worried that the workarounds could further balloon the cost of the tax cuts, which are projected to add more than $1 trillion to the national debt over a decade.In January, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, scolded states that were looking for loopholes.‚I hope that the states are more focused on cutting their budgets and giving tax cuts to their people in their states than they are in trying to evade the law,‚ he said.On Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, praised the I.R.S. for taking action.‚It‚s unfortunate that some politicians are still trying to discredit this new economic momentum in defense of high taxes and stagnant growth,‚ Mr. Brady said. ‚I applaud the administration for responding to these gimmicks.‚Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation in Washington, which has long criticized the state and local tax deduction, said the I.R.S. appeared to be moving toward a ‚substance over form‚ doctrine for evaluating whether payments made in exchange for the new state tax credits qualify as charitable deductions. The I.R.S. test, he said, would look at whether states devised the payments to allow residents to circumvent federal tax liability. He said there is support in past regulations and court rulings for such a standard.‚What seems very clear is that the I.R.S. is neither fooled by nor particularly flummoxed by recharacterization of federal tax liability,‚ he said.But some tax experts warn that the I.R.S. could unintentionally hurt taxpayers who benefit from longstanding state tax credits for charitable contributions, including those for college and private K-12 school tuition, and wind up treating states disparately. ‚State tax credits for charitable contributions to qualifying organizations in a state have historically been respected as charitable contributions in federal law, and indeed the I.R.S. once issued a memorandum to that general effect,‚ said Itai Grinberg, a tax professor at Georgetown University‚s law school.The prospect of the I.R.S. determining that a contribution to a private or religious school would be deductible, but a contribution to a charitable fund established by a public school district or by the public school district‚s parents‚ association would not be deductible ‚just seems both hard to maintain on its face and politically difficult to reach,‚ Mr. Grinberg said.Carl Davis, the research director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington, said that Alabama provides a 100 percent state tax credit for taxpayers who donate money to organizations that give children vouchers to attend private school. Under its new law, New York gives an 85 percent state tax credit to residents who donate to a state fund that supports education.Treating Alabama taxpayers as compliant with I.R.S. law but New Yorkers as not would be largely indefensible, he said.Daniel Rosen, a partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie, said that the I.R.S. is likely to face litigation to block its efforts.‚This notice was issued with the intention of dissuading taxpayers from making donations to state charitable contribution funds,‚ Mr. Rosen, who is a former lawyer for the I.R.S., said. ‚I would anticipate challenges to this notice fairly quickly.‚",I.R.S. Warns States Not to Circumvent State and Local Tax Cap,"May 23, 2018 /  4:38 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-states/u-s-treasury-readies-crackdown-on-state-salt-cap-workarounds-idUSKCN1IO2LV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Wednesday that it will soon propose regulations aimed at recent state efforts to circumvent new Republican-enacted limits on a longstanding federal tax deduction for state and local tax payments. The new rules will assert the authority of the Internal Revenue Service over workaround strategies, the Treasury and IRS said in a public notice. Most state workarounds have surfaced in “blue” states with Democratic majorities, where many taxpayers now face higher tax bills.         The Republican-controlled Congress capped the federal state and local tax (SALT) deduction at $10,000 in tax legislation that President Donald Trump signed into law in December. The move spawned official protests in states where the popular deduction has helped mitigate the burden of state and local taxes that fund local services including public education. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have already adopted measures that allow taxpayers to fund municipal governments by making tax-deductible charitable donations to specified funds in lieu of taxes. California, Illinois and Nebraska could follow a similar path.  New York allows taxpayers donating to state funds that support education and healthcare to receive up to 85 percent of their donation back in the form of a state tax credit.  The Trump administration suggested workarounds that use federal tax deductions could exceed the jurisdiction of state governments.  “The proposed regulations will make clear that the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, informed by substance-over-form principles, govern the federal income tax treatment of such transfers,” Treasury and the IRS said. Republicans in Congress welcomed news of the impending regulations.  “I applaud the administration for responding to these gimmicks,” said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and a main author of the SALT deduction cap. But the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, or ITEP, warned that narrow action could have unintended consequences for federal charitable donations if the government imposes arbitrary distinctions between different types of organizations. The group said Congress is better positioned to act fairly.    “The gifts being made under these schemes are not truly ‘charitable’ according to any commonsense definition of that word, since taxpayers are made financially better off by their gifts,” ITEP said in a report released on Wednesday.   “But fixing this problem will be more difficult than many observers have recognized,” it added.

But his F.B.I. background checks dragged on for a year and became one of many political distractions for the White House. Even some inside the administration suspected that Mr. Kushner‚s delay reflected legal problems on the horizon.The permanent clearances make Mr. Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump‚s daughter Ivanka Trump, eligible to view some of the United States‚ most closely guarded secrets, including the daily intelligence briefing that Mr. Trump receives and the delicate intelligence on the Israelis and the Palestinians that former diplomats said can be valuable in negotiations. Top-secret clearances are typically required for people viewing foreign intelligence or sitting in on high-level White House meetings.White House officials were adamant that the lengthy process was not unusual for a government official who has a complicated financial history and many foreign contacts. But with the special counsel investigating some of Mr. Kushner‚s meetings with Russian officials, it left open the question of whether investigators had uncovered evidence that made him a security threat. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating whether anyone around Mr. Trump conspired with the Russian government to help influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Kushner‚s meetings with the Russian ambassador, a Kremlin-connected lawyer and a prominent Russian banker have all attracted scrutiny.The resolution of his clearances does not guarantee that Mr. Kushner faces no legal jeopardy. But Mark S. Zaid, a veteran Washington lawyer who handles security clearances, said it was highly unlikely that the special counsel would uncover evidence of improper foreign entanglements and not flag it for security officials.‚If I were Jared Kushner, I‚d be sighing a breath of relief today,‚ Mr. Zaid said.The special counsel‚s investigation had not caused the delay, said Mr. Kushner‚s lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell.‚With respect to the news about his clearances, as we stated before, his application was properly submitted, reviewed by numerous career officials and underwent the normal process,‚ Mr. Lowell said. ‚Having completed all of these processes, he‚s looking forward to continuing to do the work the president has asked him to do.‚Mr. Kushner has outlasted some of his chief White House rivals, including Reince Priebus and Stephen K. Bannon. But his relationship with the current chief of staff, John F. Kelly, deteriorated from almost the very beginning. And Mr. Trump, who once considered Mr. Kushner a trusted adviser, continues to tell friends he wishes that Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump would return to New York, although Mr. Trump has not voiced this view to his daughter and Mr. Kushner in several months. The clearance announcement will not drastically change Mr. Kushner‚s ability to play peacemaker in the Middle East. Even without a top-secret clearance, he was able to attend meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials.A White House spokesman did not respond to a message seeking comment. Mr. Kushner‚s clearances were approved by career officials after the completion of the F.B.I. background check, and the president was not involved in the process, according to the person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because clearance decisions are supposed to be secret.Mr. Lowell said that Mr. Kushner has cooperated fully with the special counsel and met with Mr. Mueller‚s investigators twice for many hours. ‚In each occasion, he answered all questions asked and did whatever he could to expedite the conclusion of the investigations,‚ Mr. Lowell said.Mr. Kushner was among several White House officials who spent the first year of the administration working under provisional clearances, meaning he was allowed to view classified information while his F.B.I. background check was pending.Those interim clearances became stand-ins for the larger Washington debate over links between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Mr. Trump‚s team steadfastly denied any such contacts, only to have journalists and investigators uncover one undisclosed meeting after another.Mr. Kushner met during the campaign with a Russian lawyer who came to Trump Tower promising political dirt on Hillary Clinton. During the presidential transition, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, and the head of a Russian state-owned bank. But when he applied for a security clearance, Mr. Kushner did not disclose those meetings.His lawyers said the application was filed inadvertently, while the form was still in progress. They said he did not conceal Russian contacts; he had not yet begun completing the section requiring him to disclose his foreign contacts. As a New York real estate developer and the point person for the presidential transition on many diplomatic issues, Mr. Kushner had many such contacts. Mr. Kushner amended the form and was interviewed by Congress about his Russian contacts. ‚All of my actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events of a very unique campaign,‚ Mr. Kushner said last July after speaking behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. ‚I did not collude with Russians, nor do I know of anyone in the campaign who did.‚Congressional Democrats, though, clamored for more information about Mr. Kushner‚s clearances. In February, amid questions about an aide who kept his interim clearances despite accusations of domestic violence, the White House stripped Mr. Kushner and others of their provisional access to classified information.That led only to new questions about Mr. Kushner‚s relationship with Mr. Kelly and his future in the White House. In addition to his work on Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, Mr. Kushner acts as an intermediary with Mexico, is pushing for reforms to federal prisons and is working on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement.","Jared Kushner Gets Security Clearance, Ending Swirl of Questions Over Delay","May 23, 2018 /  10:12 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-kushner/trump-adviser-and-son-in-law-jared-kushner-gets-security-clearance-back-idUSKCN1IO3E5,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law, has had his security clearance restored, allowing him access to classified information after losing the privilege in the fallout over a fired White House aide, his lawyer said on Wednesday.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque When he joined the White House staff in January 2017, Kushner gained access to sensitive information through a temporary security clearance while the FBI conducted a background check to see if he qualified for a permanent clearance. His temporary clearance was suspended by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly in February along with other officials operating under temporary clearances as part of measures to tighten procedures after White House staff secretary Rob Porter was fired when his two ex-wives raised charges of domestic abuse. “With respect to the news about his permanent security clearance, as we stated before, his application was properly submitted, reviewed by career officials, and went through the normal process. Having completed these processes, Mr. Kushner is looking forward to continuing the work the president has asked him to do,” said Kushner attorney Abbe Lowell. Kushner is leading a Trump effort to resurrect the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and has been a Trump conduit to Mexico, among other activities. It took an unusually long time for Kushner’s background check to be completed, raising questions about whether he might be in trouble in U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Kushner,  who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, attended a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Donald Trump Jr., and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Lowell, in a statement, said Kushner has cooperated fully with the investigation, including sitting for two interviews with the special counsel’s office. “In each occasion, he answered all questions asked and did whatever he could to expedite the conclusion of all the investigations,” Lowell said. According to a person familiar with the situation, Kushner was interviewed for a second time by the Mueller team in the second week of April. It lasted more than six hours. The questions covered issues related to whether there was collusion between Russian figures and the Trump campaign, and any contacts during the Trump post-election transition period to the presidency, among other issues, the source said. According to the person, Mueller’s team did not ask questions about Kushner’s business or finances, including his family’s real estate company.

Mr. Brown‚s car is parked in a handicapped zone, and the situation swiftly escalates into a confrontation with multiple officers and squad cars.At one point, the officers push Mr. Brown to the ground and one officer calls out ‚Taser, Taser, Taser,‚ after which a stun gun is used on Mr. Brown.During the video, Mr. Brown does not appear to raise his voice or physically resist officers.‚I own this right here,‚ an officer says at one point. ‚You don‚t own me,‚ Mr. Brown responds. In a news conference late Wednesday, the chief, Alfonso Morales, said he was ‚sorry this incident escalated to this level.‚ He said that an investigation of the events by the department revealed that ‚members acted inappropriately and those members were recently disciplined.‚ He offered no details, however, and did not provide names of the officers involved.At City Hall, Milwaukee‚s mayor, Tom Barrett, said that ‚as a human being, I am offended by what I saw.‚ He said: ‚Mr. Brown deserves an apology, and I am very sorry the Milwaukee police treated him in the fashion he was treated.‚Mr. Barrett declined to say how many officers were disciplined or describe the extent of that discipline. He said he expected that information to be released eventually, but that department procedure prevented that from being divulged immediately.In a statement, Mr. Brown said Wednesday that his treatment by the police was wrong and ‚has forced me to stand up and tell my story so that I can help prevent these injustices from happening in the future.‚‚Situations like mine and worse happen every day in the black community,‚ Mr. Brown said.In a separate statement, the Bucks organization, for whom Mr. Brown plays, said it supported him. ‚The abuse and intimidation that Sterling experienced at the hands of Milwaukee police was shameful and inexcusable,‚ the team‚s statement said.Fred Royal, the president of the Milwaukee branch of the N.A.A.C.P., called for changes to the Police Department‚s policies. ‚For a person to go and have to be physically accosted at the hands of police for a parking citation speaks volumes,‚ he said.Police conduct toward black people has been a fraught issue in Milwaukee, where protesters have held demonstrations repeatedly in recent years in the wake of police shootings and the release of videos showing rough arrests.The Milwaukee Police Association, a union representing rank-and-file officers, released a lengthy statement about the video on Wednesday evening that said ‚the cause or need for force is always dictated by the subject confronting the police officer.‚‚Unfortunately, society and local leaders only take issue when the situation is sensational, or the individual is of prominence,‚ the union‚s statement added.Until Wednesday afternoon, few details had been made public about the arrest of Mr. Brown, who is 23, since the incident took place in January.Mr. Brown was briefly jailed but never charged with a crime. About 18 hours after his arrest, he played 27 minutes in a basketball game against the Brooklyn Nets. He had visible bruises and marks on his face. The arrest of Mr. Brown took place in the early hours of Jan. 26 outside a Walgreens store about three miles from the BMO Harris Bradley Center, where the Bucks played their home games at the time.Mr. Brown, who was in his rookie season with the Bucks, addressed the news media in January and called the situation a ‚personal issue.‚‚It‚s being handled,‚ Mr. Brown told reporters then. ‚I‚d appreciate if y‚all would respect that right now.‚ Mostly a reserve, he played in 54 games, averaging 4 points and 2.6 rebounds a game.As of Wednesday, the local prosecutor‚s office said it had not been involved in the case. Kent Lovern, the chief deputy district attorney in Milwaukee County, said in an email Wednesday morning that ‚no charges against anyone in this incident have ever been referred to this office.‚ Mr. Lovern said he had not seen the video before it was made public on Wednesday afternoon.Milwaukee, which has overhauled leadership of its police department in the months since Mr. Brown‚s arrest, has previously struggled with relations between the police and its residents. In 2016, when an officer fatally shot a man who was fleeing, the city experienced two nights of unrest. That officer was acquitted of reckless homicide in 2017, but was convicted of several unrelated charges, including false imprisonment and solicitation of prostitutes. He is currently in prison and is no longer a police officer.On Tuesday, with word circulating that release of the video was imminent, Chief Morales released a video asking for trust in the department and pledging transparency when officers commit misconduct. (A day later, he declined to answer any questions from reporters.)Chief Morales took over as the department‚s interim leader in February, about three weeks after Mr. Brown‚s arrest, and was named chief in April. He replaced Edward A. Flynn, whose 10-year term as chief included struggles with high homicide rates and strained community relations. ‚If there‚s ever an incident where one of our members makes a mistake, unnecessarily escalating a situation, I‚m going to be honest and transparent about it,‚ Chief Morales, a 25-year veteran of the Milwaukee police, said in the video. ‚In those instances where we have made mistakes and are wrong, I‚m sorry.‚The episode in Milwaukee was among several recent encounters in which police officers were recorded using force to subdue a professional athlete.In 2017, Michael Bennett, then of the Seattle Seahawks, was taken to the ground and handcuffed by the police in Las Vegas.Months later, video captured a violent encounter between Georgia police officers and Desmond Marrow, a former N.F.L. player.Mr. Marrow, who was accused of participating in a road rage incident, was seen on the video being forced down by three officers. Mr. Marrow said ‚I‚m not even fighting back‚ as he was thrown to the ground.As the video of Mr. Brown‚s arrest was seen on Wednesday night, some professional athletes shared their disgust about it over social media.‚I hope he sues the Milwaukee PD and the officers involved,‚ wrote Reggie Miller, a Hall of Fame basketball player, on Twitter. Brandon Jennings and Malcolm Brogdon, both teammates of Mr. Brown last season, each posted images on social media that said ‚#standwithsterling.‚ In the video of Mr. Brown‚s arrest, he can be seen several minutes after being Tasered, standing up with his arms behind his back. He tells an officer: ‚You initiated everything.‚ The officer responds, ‚No, you initiated everything.‚A few moments later, the officer says, ‚I don‚t follow the Bucks, so I didn‚t recognize you. I didn‚t recognize your famous name.‚‚No, it ain‚t famous,‚ Mr. Brown responds. ‚It‚s legit.‚",Video of Sterling Brown‚Äôs Arrest Shows Milwaukee Police Using Stun Gun on N.B.A. Player,"June 19, 2018 /  10:10 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wisconsin-police-lawsuit/nba-player-sues-milwaukee-police-claiming-excessive-force-idUSKBN1JF36H,"(Reuters) - A National Basketball Association player on Tuesday filed a civil lawsuit in federal court alleging Milwaukee police used excessive force in a January arrest that he claims officers unnecessarily escalated from a simple parking violation. FILE PHOTO: Brooklyn Nets center Jarrett Allen (31) and Milwaukee Bucks guard Sterling Brown (23) reach for a rebound during the first quarter of NBA basketball game in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S., January 26, 2018.  Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports /File PhotoAccording to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee, Sterling Brown, a guard for the Milwaukee Bucks who is black, was wrongfully arrested and mistreated because of his race by a police department with a history of excessive force against black people. The suit claims one of eight police officers named as defendants in the suit pulled his gun and another used a stun gun on Brown after he was already subdued and being held on the ground by several other officers. In addition to the eight officers, the city of Milwaukee and its police chief, Alfonso Morales, are defendants in the case. Local media has reported that most of the officers involved are white. The suit seeks unspecified damages. Brown’s attorney, Mark Thomsen, told Reuters on Tuesday that Brown was not motivated by money in filing the suit, but rather seeks a change in the way Milwaukee police treat young black men. Morales was named chief in February, but the suit claims he did not handle discipline of the officers well as the stiffest penalty was suspension for three of the officers, varying from two to 15 days. Morales has previously apologized for the arrest. A call and an email to the Milwaukee Police Department were not immediately returned on Tuesday.  The suit alleges Brown parked in a handicapped parking spot outside a drug store about 2 a.m. on Jan. 26, and was approached by a Milwaukee officer who shoved Brown and subsequently called for backup. The player was never charged with anything in the incident. Officers surrounded Brown as they questioned him and one pulled out a gun after two policemen noticed what appeared to be targets from a gun range in the player’s car.  Brown, a 23-year-old reserve player on the NBA team, was unarmed. “It’s simply outrageous that someone would pull their gun” in this situation where Brown posed no serious danger to any of the officers, Thomsen told Reuters. The suit says that Brown, who was 22 at the time of the incident, “was kneed in the groin by one of the officers” before being thrown to the cold pavement during a night when the wind chill temperature was 26 degrees Fahrenheit (-3 degrees Celsius). Brown was already on the ground held by officers when he was shocked with the stun gun in the back, the suit claims. The suit also claims that several of the officers switched off body cameras to conceal their actions and some of them conspired to synchronize their stories after the incident.

But it said that no other cases had been reported.‚A U.S. government employee in China recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure,‚ the health alert said. ‚We do not currently know what caused the reported symptoms and we are not aware of any similar situations in China, either inside or outside of the diplomatic community.‚The employee was working in Guangzhou, and ‚reported experiencing a variety of physical symptoms‚ from late 2017 until April, Jinnie Lee, a spokeswoman for the United States Embassy in Beijing, said in an emailed response to questions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday that medical teams were heading to Guangzhou to address the issue.‚The medical indications are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba,‚ he said.The embassy was told on Friday ‚that the clinical findings of this evaluation matched mild traumatic brain injury,‚ according to Ms. Lee, who said she could not reveal any more details to protect the employee‚s privacy. Mild traumatic brain injury can show up as headache, dizziness, nausea, poor memory and a general foggy sensation.In a brief afternoon news conference at the State Department with China‚s foreign minister, Wang Yi, Mr. Pompeo said that the Chinese ‚have responded in a way that is exactly the right response.‚‚They‚ve offered to assist us in investigating how this came to be,‚ Mr. Pompeo said, without mentioning that Cuba had made a similar offer that the United States treated with some skepticism. He added, ‚We‚re working together to resolve it.‚ Mr. Wang said that China had yet to find that ‚any organization or individual has carried out such a sonic influence,‚ and he expressed the hope that the incident would not harm relations.‚We don‚t want to see that this individual case will be magnified, complicated, or even politicized,‚ Mr. Wang said. ‚China will, in accordance with the law, protect all the lawful rights and interests of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats.‚The American statements did not say that officials suspected any foul play by the Chinese authorities. Even so, if the illness remains unsolved, it could become a complicating irritant at a time when Beijing and Washington are embroiled in tensions over trade and investment, and when American distrust of China is growing on many fronts.The echoes of the burst of illnesses suffered by American diplomats in Cuba may add to those complications.Starting in late 2016, diplomats posted to the United States Embassy in Havana began complaining of hearing strange, wrenching noises and suffering symptoms like headaches, dizziness and loss of hearing. A total of 24 Americans were confirmed as suffering from the attacks, most of them diplomats and some diplomats‚ spouses. The cause of the illnesses in Cuba has not been confirmed, but American suspicions that the Cuban government was behind them, or at least knew who was, have added to a sharp deterioration in ties under the Trump administration. The United States has expelled at least 17 Cuban diplomats to underscore its view that Cuba bears some responsibility. But the Cuban government has denied any role, and experts have sharply disagreed over the likely cause of the illnesses. Some have said they probably resulted from sonic equipment that was deliberately or accidentally set to emit damaging sounds. Others have said that the cases were probably the result of psychological suggestion.‚The most challenging factor is the lack of certainty about the causative agent and, therefore, the precise mechanism of the injuries suffered,‚ Charles Rosenfarb, the medical director of the State Department‚s Bureau of Medical Services, told lawmakers investigating the illnesses.Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, frequently dismissed the notion that Cuba could have been unaware of what American diplomats termed an ‚attack.‚‚The idea that someone could put together some sort of action against them, 24 of them, and the Cuban government not know who did it, it‚s just impossible,‚ Mr. Rubio said in a Senate hearing in January.He and others also speculated that another foreign power, perhaps Russia, had been behind or part of the Havana attack. With similar problems appearing elsewhere in the world, that argument will probably gain steam, as Cuba is unlikely to have the capacity to engage in similar attacks elsewhere in the world.More than a year after the mystery attacks began in Cuba, there are few indications that American investigators are any closer to identifying what may have caused the problem.About 2,000 employees of the United States government are posted in China, said Ms. Lee, the embassy spokeswoman. Diplomats based in the country are probably among the most closely watched by Chinese security services. But it is unclear what might drive Chinese agents to risk inflicting brain injury on an American government employee, especially in a heavily commercial posting like Guangzhou, which is 1,200 miles south of Beijing. The United States Consulate there is housed in a secure, boxlike building that was opened in 2013.The Global Times, a Beijing newspaper that often gives strident voice to the Chinese government‚s views, said in an online editorial that the notion that China would attack foreign government personnel was ‚totally preposterous.‚‚We‚re very sure that the ‚brain injury‚ to the American consulate employee can‚t possibly have any ‚background,‚‚ the editorial said. ‚There should be repeated screening for individual health causes, including psychological causes.‚Still, the State Department was not taking chances.‚While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source,‚ the notice from the consulate said. ‚Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present.‚","First Cuba, Now China?

A vintage car passes by in front of the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, January 12, 2017. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini The State Department said on Friday the cases were similar to those of 24 diplomats and family members taken ill through 2017, leading to a drawdown of personnel in Havana to a skeleton staff and the expulsion of 17 Cuban diplomats from Washington.  The United States also issued a travel warning for its citizens. Sunday’s foreign ministry statement termed those actions politically motivated, pointing out that “after more than a year of investigations by Cuba and the United States ... there are no credible hypotheses nor scientific conclusions that justify the actions taken by the U.S. government against Cuba.” The statement said Cuba was informed of one case in late May where “a functionary of the (U.S.) embassy on the 27th of the same month had reported health symptoms as a result of ‘undefined sounds’ in her residence.” The statement said an exhaustive search of the area around the residence had turned up nothing out of the ordinary and its specialists had been denied access to the functionary. Cuba said it remained ready to work with the United States to determine what, if anything, was causing the illnesses after its own investigation had uncovered no evidence of foul play. U.S. experts have yet to determine who or what is behind the mysterious illnesses. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has partly rolled back a detente with Cuba, first charged diplomats were the victims of “sonic attacks” and Cuba as the host country was at a minimum responsible for their safety. Symptoms suffered by the diplomats have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with “mild traumatic brain injury,” State Department officials have said. In April, Canada, whose personnel were also stricken, said it would remove families of diplomats posted at its embassy in Cuba as information from medical specialists has raised concerns of a new type of brain injury.  The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday it has brought a group of diplomats home from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering from a mysterious malady that resembles a brain injury and has already affected U.S. personnel in Cuba.

Defense Department officials said on Wednesday that China‚s decision to place surface-to-air missile systems and other offensive weaponry on the islands spurred the move.The military snub comes after President Trump suggested the Chinese might be influencing North Korea‚s recent talk of withdrawing from a summit meeting set for June 12 to discuss the dismantling of Pyongyang‚s nuclear program. Washington and Beijing also are in the middle of a major trade fight that is part of a perennial battle over market access and technology policy.The conflict over China‚s military buildup in the disputed islands adds another layer to the overall tensions between the two global economic powers. ‚We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea,‚ Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.He added that ‚China‚s landing of bomber aircraft at Woody Island has also raised tensions.‚It marks the first time that China has been disinvited from RimPac, Commander Logan said.Beijing‚s militarization of the South China Sea islands ‚ which have been claimed variously by China, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines ‚ has been for years a source of tension.During his campaign, Mr. Trump labeled President Barack Obama as weak in defending international waters in the South China Sea, where Beijing has started a sharp military buildup to reclaim land, install runways and haul equipment onto reefs and shoals it claims as its own. Several of Mr. Trump‚s aides called for China to be denied access to the artificial islands. [Read more about China‚s military buildup in the South China Sea.]During the first few months of the Trump administration, foreign policy experts and Asia watchers braced for a return to routine Navy patrols within China‚s self-proclaimed territorial waters, something Mr. Obama allowed sparingly.But freedom of navigation naval patrols, which are used by the United States to challenge Chinese claims to the islands, continued sparingly. Top Pentagon officials rejected three requests by the Navy to conduct the freedom of navigation patrols in the initial months of Mr. Trump‚s presidency, before resuming them again last year.China has brought additional equipment to the disputed islands and bomb-proofed airplane hangars it built there. Its government says that such action does not constitute a militarization of the islands, which Beijing considers to be Chinese territory and therefore it cannot militarize land it already owns.The United States and other countries disagree.‚China‚s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,‚ Commander Logan said in the Pentagon statement.

PLA is the English-language acronym of China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army. Logan did not specify what else the U.S. government might do to respond but stressed there was “strong evidence” that China had deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands. “We find that a very unconstructive move,” the Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councilor Wang Yi, told reporters in Washington after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Wang described China’s activity in the South China Sea as self-defense, saying it was working on a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset.” Related CoverageChina slams U.S. for linking exercise cancellation to South China SeaOver the weekend China’s air force landed bombers on disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the region, triggering concern from Vietnam and the Philippines. Satellite photographs taken on May 12 showed China appeared to have deployed truck-mounted surface-to-air missiles or anti-ship cruise missiles at Woody Island in the Paracel island chain to the north of the Spratlys, said Greg Poling, a South China Sea expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies. Poling, who heads CSIS’s Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said the images showed China had also deployed J-11 combat aircraft as part of its exercises. He said later satellite images, taken on May 20 and  published by Fox News, showed the missile systems still in place, suggesting they could be there to stay. The Rim of the Pacific exercise, known as RIMPAC, is billed as the world’s largest international maritime exercise, held every two years in Hawaii in June and July, and China has attended previously.

U.S. President Donald Trump has praised China in recent months for its help putting pressure on North Korea, even amid concerns about a potential trade war between Washington and Beijing, the world’s two largest economies. Earlier this month the United States said it had raised concerns with China about its latest militarization of the South China Sea and said there would be near-term and long-term consequences. Pentagon officials have long complained that China has not been candid enough about its rapid military build-up and using South China Sea islands to gather intelligence in the region. Chinese officials have accused Washington of viewing their country in suspicious, “Cold War” terms. “On the so-called militarization in the South China Sea, we talked about this issue just now ... It is a normal deployment and has nothing to do with militarization,” Wang said.

6196040,804,['2018-05-23t22:22:38.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/world/middleeast/saudi-women-drivers-arrests.html,"LONDON ‚ Saudi Arabia is escalating its crackdown on activists who had pressed for the right of women to drive, bringing the number arrested to at least 11 and publicly branding them as ‚traitors.‚The acceleration of the crackdown has come as a surprise because the kingdom is expected, in just three weeks, to grant the activists a victory by allowing women for the first time to drive. An international uproar over the arrests now threatens to drown out the accolades that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the dominant force in the kingdom, had previously won for announcing the rule change.But both supporters and critics of the crown prince said Wednesday that he appeared determined to portray the change as a royal gift to Saudi women rather than any concession to domestic or international pressure, even if silencing the activists overshadows the reform. ‚That sort of change has to be seen as emanating from the government itself rather than the West,‚ said Ali Shihabi, founder of the Washington-based Arabia Foundation and a supporter of the crown prince. He argued that the activists had failed to appreciate the balancing act that the crown prince faced in checking the power of the clerical hierarchy and its conservative supporters, who opposed allowing women to drive. ‚These activists got carried away with being celebrated in the West as ‚the activists driving change‚ and so on,‚ he said. ‚It all sounds nice and sexy in New York and London and Paris but in reality it is deadly.‚He added: ‚It further provokes an already resentful conservative and clerical class when the government is working very hard to temper their resentment. It puts meat on the bones of the accusation from the religious class that this is all a Western-driven agenda.‚Rights advocates said the crackdown discredited the claims by the crown prince to be a liberalizing reformer.‚The crown prince wants to be the author, the creator, the narrator and the controller, and nobody else gets a say,‚ said Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director for Human Rights Watch. ‚So if you think of ‚reform‚ as changes that he happens to think are a good idea, like letting women drive, he supports that. But if you think of ‚reform‚ as opening up space for Saudis to have rights as people, or participate as citizens with views on the reforms, then he is the opposite of a reformer.‚ Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said in new tallies released on Wednesday that the Saudi authorities had now arrested as many as 11 activists, more than double the number confirmed five days earlier.Saudi prosecutors have not disclosed the names of those arrested or any charges filed against them, but a government statement has accused them of ‚suspicious contact with foreign parties‚ and of undermining ‚security and stability.‚Pro-government news outlets and social media accounts have called them ‚traitors,‚ with one account splattering the word in red across their faces, or as ‚agents of embassies,‚ suggesting they worked for foreign governments. One newspaper said they could face as much as 20 years in prison for treason.News reports have identified some of those arrested. One of the best known, Loujain al-Hathloul, is in her late 20s; she was previously detained for more than 70 days in 2014 for trying to post an online video of herself driving into the kingdom from the United Arab Emirates. Others include a retired professor with five children and eight grandchildren; an assistant professor of linguistics who is also a blogger in English and the mother of four; a psychotherapist in her mid-60s; and a twentysomething nurse in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. One of a handful of men arrested is a lawyer who defended Ms. Hathloul when she was previously arrested.Crown Prince Mohammed, 32, is unapologetically authoritarian, and his defenders argue that top-down authoritarianism is the only way to modernize the conservative kingdom, whether by gradually opening up more freedoms for women or by liberalizing the economy to attract foreign investment.But the crown prince badly tarnished his image as an economic reformer when he ordered the arrests last fall of about 200 wealthy businessmen and officials, incarcerating them in a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and forcing many to surrender assets in exchange for their freedom. His supporters called it a crackdown on corruption. Critics ‚ and investors ‚ saw it as a shakedown. Allowing women to drive was among the most visible steps the prince has taken to loosen the kingdom‚s ultraconservative social codes, but the arrests of the activists are casting a shadow over that change, too.‚A P.R. campaign calling yourself a reformer means nothing if you are arresting peaceful activists simply because they are calling for reforms,‚ said Samah Hadid, the Middle East director of campaigns for Amnesty International.Mr. Shihabi of the Arabia Foundation said he, too, was shocked when he first heard the news. ‚The lack of an adequate explanation until today is very damaging to the kingdom.‚","Saudis Toughen Crackdown, Blunting Good Publicity Over Letting Women Drive","June 2, 2018 /  10:11 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests/saudi-arabia-releases-eight-people-held-in-activist-crackdown-idUSKCN1IY0V7,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has temporarily released eight people accused of communicating with organizations opposed to the kingdom but is holding nine others in detention, state news agency SPA reported on Saturday. The public prosecutor said it had interrogated people arrested last month, whom human rights groups identified as women’s rights activists. In a statement, the public prosecutor said the detainees had admitted to communicating and cooperating with individuals and organizations opposed to the kingdom, recruiting people to get secret information to hurt the country’s interests, and offering material and emotional support to hostile elements abroad. The statement did not identify the detainees, and Reuters was unable immediately to verify their names. A total of 17 people were arrested, eight of whom have been temporarily released, comprising five women and three men, the statement said. Nine people, five men and four women, remain in detention “after sufficient evidence was made available and for their confessions of charges attributed to them”. International rights watchdogs have reported the detention of at least 11 activists in the past few weeks, mostly women who previously campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom’s male guardianship system, which requires women to obtain the consent of a male relative for major decisions. The United Nations called on Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to provide information about the arrested activists and ensure their legal rights were guaranteed. On Sunday, the chief of the religious police, officially known as the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, hailed the prosecutor’s statement and warned against groups and individuals who “target the government’s security and stability”. A ban on women driving in the kingdom, set to be lifted on June 24, has been hailed as proof of a progressive trend. But the recent arrests have soured that image. The government announced two weeks ago that seven people had been arrested for suspicious contacts with foreign entities and offering financial support to “enemies overseas”, and said other suspects were being sought. It did not name the detainees. Last week, Saudi Arabia released four women’s rights activists, fellow activists and Amnesty International said. The terms of the release were unclear. Activists and diplomats have speculated that the new wave of arrests may be aimed at appeasing conservative elements opposed to social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It may also be a message to activists not to push demands out of sync with the government’s own agenda, they said. State-backed media had labeled those held as “agents of embassies”, unnerving diplomats in Saudi Arabia, a key ally of the United States.

6186898,804,['2018-05-23t22:22:38.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/world/middleeast/saudi-women-drivers-arrests.html,"LONDON ‚ Saudi Arabia is escalating its crackdown on activists who had pressed for the right of women to drive, bringing the number arrested to at least 11 and publicly branding them as ‚traitors.‚The acceleration of the crackdown has come as a surprise because the kingdom is expected, in just three weeks, to grant the activists a victory by allowing women for the first time to drive. An international uproar over the arrests now threatens to drown out the accolades that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the dominant force in the kingdom, had previously won for announcing the rule change.But both supporters and critics of the crown prince said Wednesday that he appeared determined to portray the change as a royal gift to Saudi women rather than any concession to domestic or international pressure, even if silencing the activists overshadows the reform. ‚That sort of change has to be seen as emanating from the government itself rather than the West,‚ said Ali Shihabi, founder of the Washington-based Arabia Foundation and a supporter of the crown prince. He argued that the activists had failed to appreciate the balancing act that the crown prince faced in checking the power of the clerical hierarchy and its conservative supporters, who opposed allowing women to drive. ‚These activists got carried away with being celebrated in the West as ‚the activists driving change‚ and so on,‚ he said. ‚It all sounds nice and sexy in New York and London and Paris but in reality it is deadly.‚He added: ‚It further provokes an already resentful conservative and clerical class when the government is working very hard to temper their resentment. It puts meat on the bones of the accusation from the religious class that this is all a Western-driven agenda.‚Rights advocates said the crackdown discredited the claims by the crown prince to be a liberalizing reformer.‚The crown prince wants to be the author, the creator, the narrator and the controller, and nobody else gets a say,‚ said Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director for Human Rights Watch. ‚So if you think of ‚reform‚ as changes that he happens to think are a good idea, like letting women drive, he supports that. But if you think of ‚reform‚ as opening up space for Saudis to have rights as people, or participate as citizens with views on the reforms, then he is the opposite of a reformer.‚ Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said in new tallies released on Wednesday that the Saudi authorities had now arrested as many as 11 activists, more than double the number confirmed five days earlier.Saudi prosecutors have not disclosed the names of those arrested or any charges filed against them, but a government statement has accused them of ‚suspicious contact with foreign parties‚ and of undermining ‚security and stability.‚Pro-government news outlets and social media accounts have called them ‚traitors,‚ with one account splattering the word in red across their faces, or as ‚agents of embassies,‚ suggesting they worked for foreign governments. One newspaper said they could face as much as 20 years in prison for treason.News reports have identified some of those arrested. One of the best known, Loujain al-Hathloul, is in her late 20s; she was previously detained for more than 70 days in 2014 for trying to post an online video of herself driving into the kingdom from the United Arab Emirates. Others include a retired professor with five children and eight grandchildren; an assistant professor of linguistics who is also a blogger in English and the mother of four; a psychotherapist in her mid-60s; and a twentysomething nurse in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. One of a handful of men arrested is a lawyer who defended Ms. Hathloul when she was previously arrested.Crown Prince Mohammed, 32, is unapologetically authoritarian, and his defenders argue that top-down authoritarianism is the only way to modernize the conservative kingdom, whether by gradually opening up more freedoms for women or by liberalizing the economy to attract foreign investment.But the crown prince badly tarnished his image as an economic reformer when he ordered the arrests last fall of about 200 wealthy businessmen and officials, incarcerating them in a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and forcing many to surrender assets in exchange for their freedom. His supporters called it a crackdown on corruption. Critics ‚ and investors ‚ saw it as a shakedown. Allowing women to drive was among the most visible steps the prince has taken to loosen the kingdom‚s ultraconservative social codes, but the arrests of the activists are casting a shadow over that change, too.‚A P.R. campaign calling yourself a reformer means nothing if you are arresting peaceful activists simply because they are calling for reforms,‚ said Samah Hadid, the Middle East director of campaigns for Amnesty International.Mr. Shihabi of the Arabia Foundation said he, too, was shocked when he first heard the news. ‚The lack of an adequate explanation until today is very damaging to the kingdom.‚","Saudis Toughen Crackdown, Blunting Good Publicity Over Letting Women Drive","May 18, 2018 /  2:59 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests/saudi-arabia-arrests-women-activists-ahead-of-lifting-of-driving-ban-idUSKCN1IJ1Z5,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has arrested at least five people, mostly women who previously agitated for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom’s male guardianship system, rights activists said on Friday. A Saudi woman tries a car simulator during women car show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia May 13, 2018. REUTERS/Faisal Al NasserLast year’s decision to end a decades-old ban on women driving cars, set to come into effect next month, has been hailed as proof of a new progressive trend in the deeply conservative Muslim country under reform-minded Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But it has also been accompanied by an apparent crackdown on dissent against critics, ranging from Islamist clerics to some of the very women who campaigned for years to end the ban. One of the rights activists, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the latest arrests were tied to advocacy for women driving: “They detained them because they do not want them to publicly claim success.” Government spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Women will be allowed to drive starting on June 24. The authorities have opened driving schools in preparation, instituted new regulations and hired women traffic police. Activists and analysts say, however, that the government is keen to avoid rewarding activism, which is forbidden in the absolute monarchy, and seems determined not to antagonize sensitivities of religious conservatives opposed to modernization. Women who previously participated in protests against the ban told Reuters last year that two dozen activists had received phone calls instructing them not to comment on the decree. Some of those arrested this week spoke out about the ban after the decision, though it was not clear what specifically led to their arrest nor what charges, if any, had been made against them. Dozens of clerics seen by the government as dabbling in politics were detained in September, a move that appears to have paved the way for lifting the driving ban. Ending the ban is part of the kingdom’s Vision 2030 reform program aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil and opening up Saudis’ cloistered lifestyles. Prince Mohammed, 32, is the face of that change. Many young Saudis regard his recent ascent to power as proof their generation is taking a central place in running a country whose patriarchal traditions have for decades made power the province of the old and blocked women’s progress.

The accusations ranged from unwanted touching to sexually suggestive comments ‚ on movie sets, in office environments and during meetings with the news media.One production assistant told CNN that she had endured several months of harassment while working on the set of ‚Going in Style,‚ a film released last year starring Mr. Freeman, Alan Arkin and Michael Caine. She said that on one occasion Mr. Freeman ‚kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear,‚ until Mr. Arkin told Mr. Freeman to stop. There were also suggestive comments and unwanted touching, such as putting his hand on her back.A woman described as a senior member of the production staff of ‚Now You See Me,‚ a 2013 movie, said Mr. Freeman would routinely comment on her physical appearance and that of her assistant.Three reporters said that Mr. Freeman made inappropriate comments to them during publicity events to promote coming films. One reporter, Chloe Melas of CNN, said that, during an interview last year about ‚Going in Style,‚ when she was six months pregnant, Mr. Freeman looked her up and down and told her, ‚You are ripe.‚ A camera caught Mr. Freeman saying ‚Boy, do I wish I was there,‚ directed toward Ms. Melas.

He won an Oscar for best supporting actor in 2005 for his role in ‚Million Dollar Baby‚ and has been nominated for four other Academy Awards.

The accusations against the Oscar-winning actor are the latest in a torrent against male actors, filmmakers and agents that have roiled Hollywood since October 2017, leading in some cases to resignations and the halting of projects.  On Friday, movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was charged with rape and other sex crimes. Similar accusations have also engulfed men in U.S. politics and business, and inspired a #MeToo social media movement by victims sharing their stories of sexual harassment or abuse. CNN reported on Thursday that it spoke with 16 people as part of its investigation into the 80-year-old actor, some of whom also alleged inappropriate behavior by Freeman at his production company, Revelations Entertainment. “I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports,” Freeman said in a statement on Friday, a day after he initially apologized. “But I also want to be clear: I did not create unsafe work environments. I did not assault women. I did not offer employment or advancement in exchange for sex. Any suggestion that I did so is completely false,” he added.  CNN said eight people told the network they were victims of what some labeled harassment and others called inappropriate behavior by Freeman. It said eight others told the network they witnessed the actor’s alleged misconduct. CNN also said other sources denied having seen any questionable behavior by the actor, and that those sources described him as being professional on set and in the office.  Freeman said he is someone who feels a need to try to make women and men feel appreciated and at ease around him. As part of that, he would often try to joke with and compliment women, in what he thought was a light-hearted and humorous way, he said.   “Clearly I was not always coming across the way I intended.  And that is why I apologized Thursday and will continue to apologize to anyone I might have upset, however unintentionally,” he said.  Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

But a built-in emergency braking system had been disabled while the car was in autonomous mode to ensure a smoother ride, according to the preliminary report of federal regulators investigating the crash.The initial findings, released on Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board, confirmed early police reports about the episode, which was the first known pedestrian fatality involving an autonomous car.The report also affirmed what many experts on self-driving cars said in the days after the crash: Uber‚s cars are loaded with sensors and cameras that should have detected a pedestrian with plenty of time to stop. But this one failed through a combination of a computer system not responding properly to the pedestrian‚s presence and a distracted safety driver.The fatal crash has raised questions about the safety of testing self-driving cars on public roads and whether companies, in their rush to be among the first to deploy this breakthrough technology, are taking enough precautions to prevent harm to other drivers and pedestrians. It has also dampened some enthusiasm for self-driving cars as a technology that researchers believe could eventually save lives because robot drivers, unlike humans, don‚t get distracted or tired and obey traffic rules. The New York Times reported that Uber‚s cars had been struggling to meet reliability standards in Arizona before the crash. Its cars required human drivers to intervene much more frequently than those of its competitors. Uber was also asking safety drivers to do more ‚ driving solo instead of in pairs ‚ even though the cars were still performing erratically.The safety board said the Uber car‚s computer system spotted 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg pushing a bicycle across a road at night in Tempe, Ariz., six seconds before impact. The system classified Ms. Herzberg, who was not in a crosswalk, first as an unrecognized object, then as another vehicle and finally as a bicycle. But it did not slow down before barreling into her at 39 miles per hour. The car‚s software system is not designed to alert the driver of an object in the road.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle equipped with Uber‚s sensing technology, comes with an automatic emergency braking system from the manufacturer.But Uber disabled that function as well as other safety features to ‚reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior,‚ according to the report. This put the onus on the safety driver to intervene to avoid a crash if necessary. The agency said Uber‚s safety driver, who was not impaired, grabbed the steering wheel in an attempt to swerve at the last second but did not start braking until after impact. The vehicle‚s operator, who was seen on dashboard cameras looking down and away from the road before the crash, told investigators that she had been monitoring the self-driving car system in the center of the car‚s dashboard. A toxicology report for the victim came back positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, investigators said, though they did not say drugs played a factor in the crash. While the safety board‚s preliminary report did not determine fault, it pointed to instances where Uber‚s testing system failed to prevent the crash.‚The circumstances of the crash was certainly damning, and this report documents it,‚ said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina, who specializes in technology and law. ‚Many of the issues raised in the report lead right back to Uber and Uber‚s testing program as a legitimate target of criticism.‚Mary Cummings, an engineering professor at Duke University who studies the interaction between humans and autonomous vehicles, said there was ‚a lack of maturity‚ in Uber‚s testing program because it was asking the drivers to do too much. The company made it hard for them to focus on their primary task: ensuring safety.Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokeswoman, said the company had worked closely with investigators over the last two months. It has started a review of its self-driving car program and plans to announce changes to its safety procedures in the coming weeks. Uber has brought on Christopher A. Hart, a former chairman of the safety board, as an adviser on its ‚overall safety culture.‚Immediately after the crash, Uber suspended testing of its self-driving cars and has not yet returned to the road.On Wednesday, the company said it was shutting down its testing operations in Arizona and laying off 300 employees, saying it wanted to move testing closer to its engineering hubs in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Uber also said it hoped to return to the road in Pittsburgh by the summer. The company has not said when it hopes the autonomous cars will return to San Francisco. But even politicians who once welcomed self-driving cars onto their roads are striking a more cautious tone. William Peduto, Pittsburgh‚s mayor, said the city would require Uber‚s cars stay under 25 miles per hour, regardless of the road‚s speed limit.Still, the crash hasn‚t significantly altered the deployment or testing plans for Uber‚s rivals.Waymo, the self-driving car company spun out from Google, has been testing cars without a safety driver in Arizona, where it is also picking up passengers as part of a test deployment of an autonomous taxi service. Waymo said it expected to start accepting fares for its self-driving taxis this year. And Cruise, a self-driving car company owned by GM, has continued testing in California.","Emergency Braking Was Disabled When Self-Driving Uber Killed Woman, Report Says","May 24, 2018 /  1:37 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-crash/uber-disabled-emergency-braking-in-self-driving-car-u-s-agency-idUSKCN1IP26K,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uber had disabled an emergency braking system in a self-driving vehicle that struck and killed a woman in Arizona in March even though the car had identified the need to apply the brakes, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary report released on Thursday. The report into the first fatal crash caused by a self-driving vehicle also disclosed that the modified 2017 Volvo XC90’s radar systems observed the pedestrian six seconds before impact but “the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle with varying expectations of future travel path.” At 1.3 seconds before impact, the self-driving system determined emergency braking was needed. But Uber said, according to the NTSB, that automatic emergency braking maneuvers in the Volvo XC90 were disabled while the car was under computer control in order to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.” The report gives new fuel to opponents in Congress who have stalled a bill designed to speed the deployment of self-driving cars on U.S. roads and puts a spotlight on the fact that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is also investigating, does not test self-driving vehicles or certify them before they are deployed on U.S. roads. Uber Technologies Inc, which voluntarily suspended testing after the crash in the city of Tempe, said on Wednesday it  planned to end testing in Arizona and focus on limited testing in Pittsburgh and two cities in California. Uber aims to resume its self-driving operations this summer, likely with smaller routes and fewer cars, the company said.  The company did not directly comment on the NTSB findings but noted it recently named a former NTSB chairman, Christopher Hart, to advise on Uber’s safety culture.  “As their investigation continues, we’ve initiated our own safety review of our self-driving vehicles program,” the company said on Thursday, adding it planned to announce changes in the coming weeks. All aspects of the self-driving system were operating normally at the time of the crash, and there were no faults or diagnostic messages, the NTSB said. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road when she was struck by the Uber vehicle traveling 39 miles per hour (63 kph). A safety operator behind the wheel appeared to be looking down, and not at the road, moments before the crash, according to video from inside the car released by police. The operator told the NTSB she was not looking at a mobile phone but monitoring the vehicle’s self-driving systems. Tempe police said on Wednesday it had completed its investigation and turned the findings over to prosecutors to review. Police did not release the results of the probe. The NTSB said the Uber vehicle required the operator to intervene and take action, but the system was not designed to alert the operator. The report said the operator engaged the steering wheel less than a second before impact and began braking less than a second after impact. The report noted that Herzberg tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, and that she did not look in the direction of the vehicle until just before impact. ‘RECKLESS’ William Wallace, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports, called Uber “reckless” and said the NTSB report “makes it clear that a self-driving car was tested on public roads when it wasn’t safe enough to be there, and it killed a pedestrian.” He added that the system “was far too dangerous to be tested off a closed track.” Some cities expressed hesitation about immediately allowing Uber to return to testing. Pittsburgh mayoral spokesman Timothy McNulty said the mayor still “wants a full federal investigation of the accident and for Uber to agree to his demands specific to Pittsburgh testing before he would welcome them back to the city.” Sacramento, California, is interested in having Uber and other developers test in the city but wants to ensure the companies follow all regulations. “The NTSB report really shines a light on the importance of safety and security of vehicles, so I think it hardens our stance a little bit on safety and security,” said Louis Stewart, Sacramento chief innovation officer.     A spokesman for Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation said on Thursday it would ensure it was satisfied with the steps Uber has taken to ensure the safety of its automated vehicles, before resuming testing in Toronto.      Arizona’s governor in March suspended Uber’s permit for the testing, citing safety concerns. Uber has said it considers self-driving technology important to the future of its ride services, although it is not clear how it fits into the plans of new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi. He has revamped the company structure and cut expenses as Uber prepares for an initial public offering next year. The NTSB did not say when it would release its final report on the accident. The agency typically issues its final conclusions at least a year after an accident. It is also investigating a series of crashes involving Tesla Inc’s semi-autonomous “Autopilot” system after faulting the system last year after a fatal crash in Florida.

The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, while CNBC, citing a source, said Pepsi paid less than $200 million.  The acquisition is the latest by a U.S. food major looking to tap into rising demand from health conscious consumers for snacks that have low salt content and are less processed.

And the action follows growing acrimony between his supporters and the federal bureaucracy that they portray as the deep state. Unions representing government workers were quick to denounce the actions. ‚This is more than union busting ‚ it‚s democracy busting,‚ J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, said in a statement. ‚These executive orders are a direct assault on the legal rights and protections that Congress has specifically guaranteed.‚The executive orders come after a series of prominent Republican victories against public employee unions in recent years at the state level and a rollback of Obama-era policies favorable to labor at the federal level.In the coming weeks, the Supreme Court will rule on a case, propelled by years of conservative philanthropy, that could end mandatory fees for public-sector unions in more than 20 states, dealing a body blow to union coffers.The Trump administration portrayed its new rules as a needed remedy to make a sclerotic work force more efficient and responsive, but Newt Gingrich, who has been an informal adviser to the White House on Civil Service issues, has given a different explanation in the past.In an interview last year, when the administration was considering action, Mr. Gingrich, a former House speaker, said that a major impetus was the federal bureaucracy‚s ideological opposition to the Trump agenda. ‚When you learned that 97 percent of Justice Department donations went to Hillary Clinton, 99 percent of State Department donations went to Hillary, there are some reasons to believe a substantial number of people don‚t want Trump to succeed,‚ Mr. Gingrich said. ‚Should the elected president of the United States have the ability to control the bureaucracy that actively opposed him?‚Federal employees‚ unions have typically been active on behalf of Democratic presidential nominees. Mr. Cox‚s union announced its endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 campaign almost a year before the general election and had previously endorsed Barack Obama.Mr. Trump signed three executive orders. The first makes it easier to fire and discipline federal employees, which a senior administration official, who declined to be named on a call with reporters, argued had become a much too lengthy and difficult process. The administration said that it frequently took six months to a year to dismiss a poorly performing employee, followed by an appeals period averaging eight months.To streamline the process, the official said, the executive order will give poor performers only 30 days to demonstrate improvement, rather than the current limit of up to 120 days, depending on the agency.The official said the administration would also make performance a more important factor than seniority when agencies undertake layoffs.The second executive order directs federal agencies to renegotiate contracts with unions representing government employees so as to reduce waste. The anonymous administration official expressed hope that, for example, agencies could stop having to pay expenses on both sides when unions undertake appeals on behalf of fired workers.Richard Loeb, a senior policy counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, said appeals were typically handled by union lawyers not paid by the government. The administration said it would also post union contracts online so that Americans could review its efforts to negotiate better deals with government workers.The third order aims to cut down on ‚official time,‚ in which government workers who have roles in the union, like helping colleagues file grievances, are allowed to perform those roles during normal working hours for which they draw their usual salary. (An analogous concept exists for private-sector unions.) The order limits official time to 25 percent of their hours during the year.Administration officials said a subset of federal employees had been able to spend as much as 100 percent of their duty hours on union business, and estimated savings of at least $100 million a year once the order is fully in effect.Mr. Bremberg, the White House domestic policy official, said the actions would make good on the president‚s call to ‚empower every cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers and remove those that undermine the public trust or fail the American people.‚The executive order making it easier to fire poor-performing workers was an effort to expand on legislation that Congress enacted last year aimed at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which became embroiled in a scandal in 2014 over the extremely long waits that veterans were enduring for health care.According to data collected by the American Federation of Government Employees, more than 1,600 workers have been removed under the provisions of the law passed last year, called the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. Among those removed were over 200 housekeeping aides, nearly 150 nursing assistants and nearly 100 food-service workers ‚ representing three of the top four positions with the most removals.Donald F. Kettl, a professor of public policy at the University of Texas at Austin who is based in Washington, said the number of low-level employees removed suggested the department was not using the legislation to make structural reforms that would improve veterans‚ access to care. ‚It makes for a great message,‚ he said, ‚but is it really going to solve the problem?‚Conservatives were quick to voice support for the measures. ‚Today‚s announcement shows a move toward accountability for poor performers and unions while increasing workplace equity for all the dedicated and hard-working government employees who have had to pick up the slack for far too long,‚ said Kent Lassman, president and chief executive of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market advocacy group.But Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said in a statement that if the administration were truly interested in restoring public trust in the federal government, it should rein in the excesses of some of its senior appointees, not politicize the Civil Service.‚Instead of trying to erode the rights of federal employees and whistle-blowers, the administration should focus on the abuses of cabinet officials taking charter and first-class flights and buying $31,000 dining sets and $43,000 soundproof booths,‚ Mr. Van Hollen said.Union officials questioned the administration‚s use of executive action when Congress had previously addressed the issue through legislation, but administration officials said they were on firm legal ground. They conceded only that legislation was preferable because executive orders can be easily undone by a future president, and because legislation can have potentially broader reach.",Trump Moves to Ease the Firing of Federal Workers,"May 25, 2018 /  10:17 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-workers/trump-eases-firing-of-federal-workers-cracks-down-on-unions-idUSKCN1IQ355,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday signed three executive orders designed to make it easier to fire federal government workers and to crack down on the unions that represent them, drawing immediate criticism from a group representing federal employees.

The shutdowns came as a surprise to readers of the publications, because companies had two years to prepare for the new regulations.The most notable blackouts were by news organizations tied to the American media company Tronc. In addition to The Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, newspapers including The New York Daily News, The Orlando Sentinel and The Baltimore Sun were also unavailable to readers in Europe. (Tronc announced in February that it was selling The Los Angeles Times.)‚We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the E.U. market,‚ the Tronc-owned newspapers said on their websites. ‚We continue to identify technical compliance solutions that will provide all readers with our award-winning journalism.‚ The decision illustrated that some companies would prefer to lose European customers than risk being hit with the stiff penalties allowed under the new law: Fines can reach 4 percent of global revenue.[Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.]A Tronc spokeswoman was not immediately available to comment Friday morning.Several other outlets chose to restrict access for readers in Europe, including newspapers belonging to Lee Enterprises, like The Arizona Daily Star and The St. Louis Post Dispatch.The websites of many other American news organizations, including The New York Times, USA Today and The Washington Post, were accessible from Europe. Some acknowledged the new privacy rules with large disclaimers and other information to explain what information was being gathered when a reader visits the site.‚Welcome to USA Today Network‚s European Union Experience,‚ the news organization posted at the top of its website, explaining that the company would not collect personally identifiable information or other data commonly used to sell online advertising. Andrea Jelinek, chairwoman of the new European Data Protection Board, which will coordinate enforcement of the new law, criticized the blackout and said that companies had been given a long time to prepare. For weeks, businesses as varied as Uber, bike shops and restaurants have been sending notes to alert people to updated privacy policies as a result of the law, known as G.D.P.R.‚It didn‚t just fall from heaven,‚ Ms. Jelinek said in a statement. ‚Everyone has had plenty of time to prepare.‚News organizations were not alone in erecting barriers for European users. The American television broadcaster A&E Networks cut off the websites of its A&E, History and Lifetime channels. The digital advertising company Drawbridge, the social media tracker Klout and the save-it-for-later reading app Instapaper also stepped back.Europe‚s new privacy measures allow people to limit the information they leave behind when browsing social media, reading the news or shopping online. Businesses must detail how someone‚s data is being handled, and clear a higher bar to target advertising using personal information.[Here‚s how to parse the flood of G.D.P.R.-related privacy notices in your inbox.]The law had been seen as focusing on Silicon Valley tech giants like Facebook and Google, but publishers and advertising companies have warned that it will harm their businesses in particular because it restricts how information is packaged and shared to sell advertising. It is common for websites to use tracking software to gather information about visitors in order to better target ads.Digital advertising is an important source of income for many news organizations, particularly as print readership and advertising fall, but policymakers in Europe argue the practices have become intrusive and ripe for abuse, with personal information shared far beyond what most people realize.Julia Shullman, the chief privacy counsel for the digital advertising firm AppNexus, said an ‚unintended consequence‚ of G.D.P.R. was that Google would become more powerful. To compete with the online search giant, publishers and advertisers have bought, sold and traded data with different sources, a bespoke approach that is now severely restricted under the European Union‚s new rules. Many companies will now partner with the bigger company, Ms. Shullman said. ‚At least in the short term, it pushes publishers to these large platforms that dominate the market already,‚ Ms. Shullman said in an interview.Many groups in Europe, however, are not ready to cede power to behemoths like Google and Facebook. On Friday, the privacy lawyer Max Schrems filed some of the first legal complaints using G.D.P.R., alleging the two companiesare violating the law with their terms of service.The law requires ‚informed‚ consent from users, but Mr. Schrems, who has successfully sued Facebook in the past and leads the nonprofit group None Of Your Business, said the companies were using ‚forced‚ consent because users must accept a blanket privacy policy in order to continue using the service.The complaints were filed in Austria, Belgium, France and Germany, and will now be reviewed by the European data protection authorities.",U.S. News Outlets Block European Readers Over New Privacy Rules,"May 25, 2018 /  10:34 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-privacy-access/new-privacy-law-forces-some-u-s-media-offline-in-europe-idUSKCN1IQ1AK,"LONDON (Reuters) - Major U.S.-media outlets including the LA Times and Chicago Tribune were forced to shutter their websites in parts of Europe on Friday following the roll out of stringent new privacy regulations by the European Union. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on Friday, forcing companies to be more attentive to how they handle customer data with severe penalties for breaching consumers’ privacy rights. Privacy advocates have hailed the new law as a model for personal data protection in the internet era. But opponents say the new rules are overly burdensome and have warned of costly business disruption.  By mid-morning, European readers trying to access the websites of media outlets owned by the U.S. Tronc publishing group were greeted by a message saying they were “unavailable in most European countries.” The message did not explicitly name the reason for the problem but included “GDPR” in the redirected web page address. Tronc, headquartered in Chicago, owns some of America’s biggest newspapers, including the LA Times, Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and Baltimore Sun. “We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the EU market,” said the error message displayed in response to attempts to access the LA Times website in London and Brussels. “We continue to identify technical compliance solutions that will provide all readers with our award-winning journalism.” A padlock stands on a displayed European Union flag in this illustration taken May 23, 2018.

9337960,1172,['2018-05-25t09:00:03.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/top-ceo-pay-packages.html,"As economic uncertainty roils the country, the income gap between top executives and everyday employees continues to grow ever wider.This year, thanks to a rule in the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking regulation law, publicly traded corporations in the United States had to begin comparing the pay of their chief executives to the median compensation of other employees at the company. The results, collected in the Equilar 200 Highest-Paid C.E.O. Rankings, were predictably striking.Here are six pay packages that stand out.[Read our main analysis of soaring C.E.O. pay here. | See who were the highest-paid executives.] Frank Bisignano, C.E.O. of First DataTotal Reported Compensation: $102,210,396Pay Ratio: 2,028Mr. Bisignano was the second-highest paid chief executive in the country this year, and one of only two on the Equilar list to earn more than $100 million. Mr. Bisignano is routinely granted humongous pay packages by his board of directors. He was awarded $51.6 million in 2015.The median salary at First Data, which processes credit-card transactions, was $50,406, resulting in one of the highest pay ratios ‚ 2,028 ‚ on the Equilar list.First Data, which did not reply to requests for comment, promotes an employee-ownership model in which stock is a part of every employee‚s compensation, and ‚everyone is a shareholder and is rewarded as the company performs better.‚That doesn‚t mean the equity is evenly distributed. ‚Some people are getting more equity than others,‚ said Louis Hyman, a business historian at Cornell University. ‚It seems like another way to get people to work harder for a smaller cut of the pie.‚Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, co-C.E.O.s of OracleTotal Reported Compensation: $40,832,279 (Mr. Hurd) and $40,729,965 (Ms. Catz)Pay Ratio: N/AOracle has not one, but two chief executives ‚ and it compensates each of them quite generously. Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, the technology company‚s co-C.E.O.s, were each awarded about $41 million last year. Taken together, their combined pay package of $82 million would amount to the third largest of the year. Ms. Catz is one of the few chief executives of a big publicly-traded company to openly support President Donald J. Trump, and has reportedly been considered for an administration job in recent months. She was also the highest-paid female chief executive last year, and one of a dwindling number of women occupying the highest ranks of corporate America.Mr. Hurd, a longtime technology executive, has criticized the Trump administration‚s immigration policies, and could be in line to take sole control of Oracle in the event that Ms. Catz takes a government job.Oracle did not report a median employee salary or a pay ratio because its fiscal year had not ended. As is typical with most C.E.O. packages, the bulk of the pay for Ms. Catz and Mr. Hurd was composed of stock awards and stock options. Oracle declined to comment.Douglas McMillon, C.E.O. of WalmartTotal Reported Compensation: $22,179,961Pay Ratio: 1,188Walmart employs 1.5 million people in the United States, making it by far the country‚s largest private employer.Long a target for critics who say it underpays its workers, Walmart has in recent years made efforts to change this narrative. In January, the company said it would raise its starting minimum wage to $11 an hour, offer employees a onetime cash bonus, and expand parental leave.‚We have invested billions in our associates the past few years to increase wages and develop training and education programs to build a career where each job can serve as a pathway to greater opportunity,‚ Randy Hargrove, a company spokesman, said in an email, after this article was published. ‚Walmart has represented a ladder of opportunity since we started the business, and we want to make sure that‚s the case going forward everywhere we operate including in the U.S.‚The efforts have only helped so much. The median employee at Walmart made $19,177 last year. In that time, Mr. McMillon made more than $22 million, resulting in a pay ratio of 1,188. ‚At a time when too many Walmart workers face stagnant wages and tens of thousands still qualify for public assistance, is paying your C.E.O. 1,188 times the median employee really the best investment for Walmart?‚ said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a labor group. ‚Instead of pursuing billion-dollar stock buybacks and million-dollar C.E.O. payouts, Walmart needs to make the necessary investment to eradicate poverty within and among its own work force.‚Stephen Wynn, former C.E.O. of Wynn ResortsTotal Reported Compensation: $34,522,695Pay Ratio: 909In January, Steve Wynn, the casino mogul, was accused of decades of sexual abuse. Within two weeks, he had resigned, and in March, he agreed to sell his stake in the company.Mr. Wynn remains an extremely wealthy man, and was among the highest-paid chief executives in the country last year. He is worth about $3 billion, according to Forbes, and even though he will not receive severance pay, he was awarded $34.5 million last year ‚ an amount that the median employee at his company would have to work more than 900 years to earn.Michael Weaver, a Wynn spokesman, pointed out that shareholders fared well last year despite the allegations against Mr. Wynn.‚Steve Wynn‚s 2017 compensation should be considered in comparison to the 97 percent shareholder return that same year,‚ he said in an email.There is another wrinkle in Mr. Wynn‚s pay package worth noting. Mr. Wynn, a major Republican donor, appears to have taken advantage of changes to the tax law. Wynn Resorts paid eligible employees their 2017 bonuses in December, rather than in the beginning of 2018, according to Equilar. Executives who got those bonuses owed more taxes that year, but the company offered them tax equalization payments to cover the charges. The net result of this maneuvering is likely to save the company money on this year‚s tax bill, according to Equilar.Margaret Georgiadis, former C.E.O. of MattelTotal Reported Compensation: $31,275,289Pay Ratio: 4,987Ms. Georgiadis, a former Google executive, arrived at Mattel with great fanfare last year, a technology executive recruited to turn around a toy business being disrupted by online shopping. It didn‚t work out so well. Mattel shares lost about half their value last year, and last month, Ms. Georgiadis left the company. She is now the chief executive of Ancestry.com, the genealogy website.Because it operates its own factories overseas, Mattel reported one of the highest pay ratios among companies on the Equilar list, with Ms. Georgiadis being awarded a whopping 4,987 times the median employee‚s pay.‚More than half of Mattel‚s worldwide employee base consists of manufacturing plant workers in Asia and elsewhere, which of course significantly impacts our median employee pay rate,‚ said Alex Clark, a company spokesman.As a result of her departure, Ms. Georgiadis forfeited most of her reported compensation, which was in the form of stock awards and options that had not yet realized or vested. Instead, Mattel said Ms. Georgiadis earned about $10.8 million last year.Using Ms. Georgiadis‚s actual pay from last year would lower the company‚s pay ratio somewhat, but it would still be quite high. To earn the $10.8 million Ms. Georgiadis took home last year, the median Mattel employee would have to work for 1,722 years.Herv√© Hoppenot, C.E.O. of IncyteTotal Reported Compensation: $16,087,031Pay Ratio: 64Incyte, a biotechnology company with just one cancer drug on the market in the United States, had the lowest pay ratio on the Equilar list.Given the company‚s generous median salary of $253,015 and the $16.1 million awarded to Mr. Hoppenot, the chief executive, the company‚s pay ratio was 64 to 1 ‚ positively modest compared with companies like Walmart and Mattel. But look more closely, and the comparison falls flat. Incyte employs just about 1,000 people, most of them high-paid scientists and executives. The manufacturing and distribution of their products is mostly handled by contractors who do not appear on the payroll.It‚s a model popular with other drug companies on the Equilar list. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and BioMarin Pharmaceutical also had relatively low pay ratios and relatively high median salaries.Incyte did not reply to requests for comment.‚Their median pay is a quarter of a million dollars a year,‚ Mr. Hyman said. ‚You think to yourself, ‚That‚s not so bad.‚ But then you realize that all of their manufacturing is outsourced.‚ ",Six C.E.O.

I did not assault women. I did not offer employment or advancement in exchange for sex. Any suggestion that I did so is completely false,” he added.  CNN said eight people told the network they were victims of what some labeled harassment and others called inappropriate behavior by Freeman. It said eight others told the network they witnessed the actor’s alleged misconduct. CNN also said other sources denied having seen any questionable behavior by the actor, and that those sources described him as being professional on set and in the office.  Freeman said he is someone who feels a need to try to make women and men feel appreciated and at ease around him. As part of that, he would often try to joke with and compliment women, in what he thought was a light-hearted and humorous way, he said.   “Clearly I was not always coming across the way I intended.  And that is why I apologized Thursday and will continue to apologize to anyone I might have upset, however unintentionally,” he said.  Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Freeman, whose career has spanned 50 years and more than 100 movies, won a Oscar in 2005 as best supporting actor for his role as a former boxer in “Million Dollar Baby.” FILE PHOTO: Actor Morgan Freeman takes part in the opening ceremonies of the Invictus Games in Orlando Florida, U.S., May 8, 2016.

7821174,1019,['2018-05-25t11:55:24.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-arrested.html,"In a mirror image of his days presiding over Hollywood red carpets, the disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was led in handcuffs past a gantlet of photographers on Friday as he appeared in court to face charges that he had raped one woman and forced another to perform oral sex.Mr. Weinstein‚s appearance in Manhattan Criminal Court lasted barely 10 minutes, but stood not only as a breakthrough in the investigation into sex-crime claims against him but as a watershed in the larger #MeToo movement. After decades of harnessing his wealth and power to silence women ‚ and after weathering an earlier criminal inquiry into groping allegations ‚ his reign as a film-industry titan suffered a decisive blow in, of all places, the shopworn arraignment courtroom, where he was among the morning cattle call of defendants.It was 9:25 a.m. when Mr. Weinstein ‚ in a dark blazer, a light-blue sweater and an untucked button-down shirt ‚ was escorted into courtroom AR-1 by Sgt. Keri Thompson and Detective Nicholas DiGaudio, two investigators from the New York Police Department‚s Special Victims Division. The unit had been pushing hard for months on Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, to pursue a case against Mr. Weinstein, particularly after Mr. Vance declined to prosecute the groping case of an Italian model, Amber Battilana, three years ago because of what he called a lack of evidence.As the hearing opened, Mr. Weinstein, still in handcuffs and looking vaguely shellshocked, was led with his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, into the well of the court where he stood in front of Judge Kevin McGrath. The lead prosecutor in the case, Joan Illuzzi, announced the charges against him: first-degree rape and third-degree rape in one case; and first-degree criminal sex act in another. The criminal sex act count stemmed from an encounter with Lucia Evans, who first told The New Yorker, and then investigators from Mr. Vance‚s office, that Mr. Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him during what she expected would be a casting meeting at the Miramax office in TriBeCa in 2004. The victim in the rape case has not been publicly identified, but prosecutors said that that attack occurred on March 18, 2013, at 569 Lexington Avenue, the address for the DoubleTree Metropolitan Hotel. After noting that the charges had emerged after ‚months of investigation,‚ Ms. Illuzzi added that the inquiry had shown ‚that this defendant used his money, power and position to lure young women into situations where he was able to violate them sexually.‚Ms. Illuzzi also said that the investigation would continue and she asked Judge McGrath to issue an order of protection against Mr. Weinstein on behalf of one of the women, who was not identified. A grand jury remains empaneled in the case and is still looking into whether Mr. Weinstein abused more women and used his vast financial resources to keep them quiet.Mr. Weinstein said nothing during the hearing, standing with his back to a roomful of reporters. He was not required to enter a plea because he was arrested on a criminal complaint, rather than an indictment. But after the hearing, Mr. Brafman said his client intended to plead not guilty. By Wednesday, Mr. Weinstein will also have to decide whether he plans to testify in front of the grand jury. As the hearing neared an end, Mr. Brafman, one of New York City‚s top defense lawyers, handed Mr. Weinstein‚s passport to Ms. Illuzzi and paid his bail with a $1 million cashier‚s check. As part of his bail package, he has agreed to wear a monitoring device and restrict his travel to New York and Connecticut. When the proceeding was over, Mr. Weinstein was allowed to slip out of an employee door at the back of the courthouse, where he climbed into a waiting Toyota.All told, his passage through the courts took about an hour, a far shorter and much less grueling ordeal than most defendants endure.Outside the courthouse, Mr. Brafman told a scrum of reporters that he would ‚move quickly‚ to dismiss the charges, calling them ‚constitutionally flawed and factually unsubstantiated.‚ ‚I anticipate that the women who have made these allegations, when subjected to cross-examination ‚ in the event we get that far ‚ will not be believed by 12 people,‚ Mr. Brafman said. He continued: ‚Assuming we get 12 fair people who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken this case.‚Hinting at a potential line of defense, Mr. Brafman also drew a distinction between bad behavior and criminal conduct. ‚Mr. Weinstein did not invent the casting couch in Hollywood,‚ he said. ‚Bad behavior is not on trial in this case.‚As is the case in many sex crimes prosecutions, whether the charges brought on Friday ultimately stick is likely to hinge on the issue of the complainants‚ credibility. It remains unclear how much physical evidence investigators have found to corroborate their stories, and Mr. Brafman in his comment promised ‚a vigorous cross-examination.‚ The day had started early for Mr. Weinstein. Around 7:30 a.m., he walked into the First Precinct station house in Lower Manhattan, flanked by several sex crimes detectives and hounded by another gaggle of reporters and photographers. Toting three large books under his arm, he looked up without saying a word as shutters clicked and onlookers called out, ‚Harvey!‚He was fingerprinted and formally booked and waited in a holding cell for detectives to finish paperwork. Then, about an hour later, he was led from the station house in TriBeCa and taken to the court at 100 Centre Street, his arms pinned behind him in three sets of handcuffs to accommodate his girth, a law enforcement official said. The books he had been carrying ‚ among them ‚Elia Kazan: A Biography,‚ by Richard Schickel, and ‚Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein‚s Broadway Revolution,‚ by Todd S. Purdum ‚ were gone.The charges against Mr. Weinstein followed a wave of accusations that led women around the world ‚ some of them famous, but many of them not ‚ to come forward with accounts of being sexually harassed and assaulted by powerful men. Those stories spawned the global #MeToo movement, and since then, the ground has shifted beneath men who for years had benefited from a code of silence around their predatory behavior. Mr. Weinstein himself had reigned for decades as one of Hollywood‚s top producers, known as much for his bullying and aggression as for his cinematic triumphs. Over the years, journalists and investigators, chasing leads from a whisper-network of women and a handful of complainants, sought to expose the accusations and hold him accountable, but largely came up empty. Mr. Weinstein‚s power was after all enormous; his (and his lawyers‚) connections were extensive; and he was often able to buy or coerce the silence of any accusers, at times employing an Israeli security firm called Black Cube, many of whose employees were former intelligence operatives.But everything shifted in October when The New York Times and The New Yorker published articles containing the accounts of several A-list movie stars and employees of the Weinstein Company, his former namesake production firm. The matching articles shattered Mr. Weinstein‚s reputation and eventually spurred criminal inquiries in New York, Los Angeles and London.Mr. Vance‚s prosecutors, for example, conducted dozens of interviews in New York and elsewhere and issued hundreds of subpoenas. A similar but separate federal investigation is also being conducted into Mr. Weinstein‚s finances and into the question of whether he violated stalking laws in his dealings with women who say he abused them. The First Police Precinct station house, where Mr. Weinstein was arrested, was not unfamiliar to him or his accusers. Three years ago, Ms. Battilana, the model, accused Mr. Weinstein of groping her during a meeting in his office, and spoke to detectives at the same station house, on Varick Street.The next day, with detectives watching and recording, Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Battilana met at the TriBeCa Grand, where Mr. Weinstein acknowledged he had touched her breasts and promised not to do so again. But he was not asked about putting his hand up Ms. Battilana‚s skirt as she had alleged. Detectives took Mr. Weinstein to the First Police Precinct for questioning, but as soon as the groping allegation came up, he halted the interview and asked for a lawyer, the police said.Unlike in the case announced on Friday, the Manhattan district attorney‚s office decided that time not to charge him.","Arrested on Rape Charges, Weinstein Posts $1 Million Bail","May 25, 2018 /  11:31 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/people-harvey-weinstein/update-10-film-mogul-weinstein-appears-handcuffed-in-court-to-face-rape-charges-idUSL2N1SW0E7,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein appeared in handcuffs in a New York court on Friday to face charges of rape and other sex crimes against two of the scores of women who have accused him of misconduct, ending his reign as a Hollywood kingpin. Weinstein, the 66-year-old co-founder of the Miramax film studio and the Weinstein Co, intends to plead not guilty to the charges, his attorney, Benjamin Brafman, told reporters outside the Manhattan courthouse.  Prosecutors charged him with two counts of rape and one count of a criminal sexual act following a months-long investigation with the New York Police Department. They did not identify the two women, but said the crimes took place in 2004 and 2013. If convicted on the most serious charges, Weinstein could face between five and 25 years in prison.  Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women, with some of the allegations dating back decades. He has denied ever having nonconsensual sex. The accusations, first reported last year by the New York Times and the New Yorker, gave rise to the #MeToo movement, in which hundreds of women have publicly accused powerful men in business, government and entertainment of sexual misconduct. “This defendant used his position, money and power to lure young women into situations where he was able to violate them sexually,” prosecutor Joan Illuzzi said at Weinstein’s arraignment on Friday in Manhattan Criminal Court. Weinstein, wearing a dark jacket over a blue sweater and white open-collared shirt and dark jeans, appeared pale, and stood next to Brafman, staring into the middle distance with his mouth ajar while prosecutors described a bail agreement. Judge Kevin McGrath ordered Weinstein released on $1 million cash bail and the case was adjourned to July 30. Weinstein surrendered his U.S. passport and agreed to wear a monitoring device that tracks his location, confining him to the states of New York and Connecticut. Weinstein earlier turned himself in at a lower Manhattan police station around 7:25 a.m. EDT (1125 GMT). He carried thick books under his right arm, including biographies of Broadway musical duo Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, and Elia Kazan, the director of “A Streetcar Named Desire” and other classic Hollywood films. Related CoverageWeinstein attorney Brafman could face 'impossible' task: lawyersAbout 90 minutes later, Weinstein was led by officers into court in handcuffs, grimacing, with his head bowed and his books nowhere in sight. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Brafman signaled he would defend Weinstein by undermining the credibility of his client’s accusers. A jury would not believe the women, Brafman said, “assuming we get 12 fair people who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken this case.” SURREAL Actress Rose McGowan, among the first to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault, said seeing images of him in handcuffs was surreal. “I actually did not believe this day would come,” she said on NBC’s “Megyn Kelly Today” program. “This is a big strike into the heart of abuse of power.” After the accusations became public, entertainment industry heavyweights distanced themselves from Weinstein. The Weinstein Co’s board fired him, and the company filed for bankruptcy in March.

REUTERS/Mike SegarIn 2017, Weinstein was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He had racked up Oscars for a string of films that helped define independent cinema in the 1990s, including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Pulp Fiction.” Weinstein was a fixture of elite Manhattan and Los Angeles society until his accusers came forward. He sought treatment for sex addiction at a facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, the New York Times reported.  London’s Metropolitan Police and Los Angeles prosecutors have said they are reviewing accusations of sexual assault against him. Brafman said in a May court filing that federal prosecutors in New York had opened a separate criminal investigation into the allegations. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. had been under pressure over his 2015 decision not to pursue a complaint by model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who said Weinstein had groped her without her consent.  Vance made the decision even though he had a covert police recording of Weinstein telling Gutierrez he would not do it again. The district attorney said his decision was based on the merits of the case. Last month, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo wrote a letter ordering the state attorney general to investigate how Vance and the NYPD handled sexual assault allegations, including the 2015 accusations against Weinstein. The New York charges mark the second high-profile prosecution of a once-powerful show business personality in the #MeToo era.  A month ago, Bill Cosby was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting a onetime friend, one of dozens of women who have accused the comedian and former TV star of sexual misconduct.  Slideshow (12 Images)Cosby’s conviction followed a mistrial last year on the same charges. In the retrial, the judge allowed five other accusers to tell similar stories of alleged abuse at his hands. It was unclear whether New York prosecutors would seek to have other Weinstein accusers testify against him. Other actresses who have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct include Uma Thurman and Salma Hayek.

His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, negotiated a bail package with the district attorney‚s office in advance of the arrest and Judge Kevin McGrath agreed to it. In New York, the only question a judge may consider in weighing bail is risk of flight, not whether the defendant poses a threat to the community. In this case, prosecutors agreed to let him remain free if he posted $1 million in bail, wore a tracking device, surrendered his passport and agreed not to travel outside of New York and Connecticut. He has no previous record of arrests, and the measures are considered enough to ensure he will show up to his court dates.

First, the inquiry by the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., is continuing. An investigative grand jury is now reviewing evidence of other alleged sexual assault allegations against Mr. Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to his using money to silence people. Second, since last year, federal prosecutors have been investigating possible financial improprieties by Mr. Weinstein, focusing on fraud allegations related to an AIDS charity fund-raiser. And they have broadened their inquiry to include allegations Mr. Weinstein may have violated federal stalking laws in his dealings with women who have accused him of sexual assault. Additionally, inquiries were underway in London and Los Angeles. Why didn‚t the statute of limitations preclude charging Mr. Weinstein in connection with allegations from 2004? The statute did not apply because Mr. Weinstein‚s victims described acts involving ‚forcible compulsion‚ ‚ crimes for which time limits for prosecuting them were lifted after 2001.Why didn‚t Mr. Weinstein enter a plea in court on Friday? Mr. Weinstein hasn‚t been indicted, so no plea is necessary.

A plea would be expected at a later appearance in Supreme Court, and Mr. Brafman said Mr. Weinstein intends to plead not guilty.Will the victims have to testify? They certainly must if they are subpoenaed. Prosecutors would be hard pressed to obtain a guilty verdict at trial if the victims did not testify. Will Mr. Weinstein testify?  He does not have to and often, if the evidence appears especially strong, the defendant will opt not to take the witness stand. However, if there is one accuser ‚ and it boils down to a ‚he-said, she-said,‚ debate ‚ the defendant might choose to make the case a credibility contest and testify to deny the allegations.Who is his lawyer?

Weinstein has denied having nonconsensual sex with anyone.   Weinstein was expected to surrender on Friday morning, a person familiar with the case said. The exact nature of the charges being brought against him by Manhattan prosecutors was unclear. “BOOM”, tweeted Italian actress Asia Argento, who has accused Weinstein of raping her at the Cannes film festival in 1997 when she was 21. Argento repeated her accusations in an emotional speech at the Cannes festival on Saturday.  Weinstein’s Italian attorney said on Saturday that Argento’s allegations were “completely false.” On Thursday in the United States, Weinstein’s spokesman Juda Engelmayer and Weinstein’s New York lawyer Benjamin Brafman both declined to comment. Rose McGowan, who was among the first actresses to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault, said his victims were “one step closer to justice.” “I, and so many of Harvey Weinstein’s survivors, had given up hope that our rapist would be held accountable by law,” McGowan said in a statement. “May this give hope to all victims and survivors everywhere that are telling their truths.” Former “Sopranos” actress Annabella Sciorra, who has said she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein in the 1990s, tweeted “Can’t Wait!” followed by “Anyone know where I can get front row seats?” “A Wrinkle in Time” director Ava DuVernay, one of the leaders of the Time’s Up campaign against sexual harassment in the workplace, posted a link on Twitter to news of Weinstein’s expected surrender, adding “Karma NEVER loses an address.” Tarana Burke, the founder of the wider #MeToo movement triggered by accusations against Weinstein, told Hollywood trade publication Variety that the expected charges represent a shift in the movement to change how sexual violence is handled. “This moves from the court of public of opinion into an actual courtroom,” Burke told Variety in an interview. “That is super cathartic for a bunch of the survivors, or even survivors who are not necessarily victimized by him.” Melissa Silverstein, founder of the blog Women and Hollywood, wrote on Twitter, “This is for all the women who stood up and spoke out and for those who endured years of pain who probably never thought this day would come.” Reporting by Jill Serjeant and Lisa Richwine; editing by Grant McCoolOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Hollywood women applaud impending Harvey Weinstein charges,Y
8982626,1120,['2018-05-25t13:00:14.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/sports/tennis/jelena-ostapenko-latvia-french-open.html,"RIGA, Latvia ‚ Make it big for Latvia and they do not wait long to mark the occasion.Last June in Paris, the unseeded Jelena Ostapenko, barely 20 years old, aimed fearlessly for the lines at the French Open and hit just enough of them to win not only her first Grand Slam title but her first tour singles title.By November, her home club, Enri, had inaugurated a new indoor facility named ‚A. Ostapenko Halle‚ with her own reserved practice court. (She prefers to be called Alona instead of Jelena, her given name.)The club also has installed a multimedia exhibit dedicated to her still-brief career, complete with a teddy bear won at the Wimbledon junior tournament, a congratulatory letter from Latvia‚s president, her French Open trophy and a video screen that shows in a continuous loop the broadcast of her upset victory over Simona Halep in the final in Paris.Over the top? Perhaps. But then again no Latvian tennis club has ever had a member quite like Ostapenko, the first Grand Slam singles champion in the Baltic nation‚s turbulent history. ‚It feels cool,‚ Ostapenko said as she led a tour of the facility last month. ‚Especially when you drive from the airport to Riga and on the right side you see the club and my name.‚Ostapenko won the French Open by repeatedly going for broke with her returns and groundstrokes, whether she was firmly planted in the red clay or stretched out wide with very little margin for error.‚It‚s not percentage tennis, but it worked, and I hope it will work again sometime,‚ said Anastasija Sevastova, her Latvian compatriot and Fed Cup teammate. ‚She plays how she is in life. She‚s so confident. She knows she will make it. That‚s why she won a Grand Slam.‚With about two million inhabitants, Latvia has a smaller population than Connecticut or Albania. But in women‚s tennis, it is making a mockery of the demographics, and at least for the moment it has more top 20 players than Spain, France, Australia, China or Russia. Ostapenko is ranked fifth as she prepares to defend her title ‚ and a lot of computer points ‚ in Paris this week. The more artful, less forceful Sevastova ‚ a 28-year-old master of the drop shot ‚ is ranked 20th and reached the quarterfinals of the United States Open in 2016 and 2017. Ernests Gulbis, a wildly unpredictable talent, was the first Latvian player to make a mark in the 2000s by breaking into the men‚s top 10 briefly in 2014 after reaching the French Open semifinals with Ostapenko watching from his box.But it is the Latvian women who have made the deeper impression. Ostapenko is arguably the second-most prominent active athlete in the country behind Kristaps Porzingis, the 7-foot-3 Knicks star who is 22.Both like to drive fast, which can be problematic in a country where speed limits are low (50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, per hour, in urban areas; 90 kilometers, about 56 m.p.h., on highways). According to Latvian news media reports, Porzingis had his driver‚s license suspended last year for speeding. Ostapenko is well aware of the risks but is fighting daily temptation as she zooms around Riga in her blue Porsche Macan.‚The police are behind meeee,‚ she shouted, scanning her rearview mirror as she gave two visitors a tour of the capital between appointments. ‚The police are O.K. with the athletes, but look what happened to Porzingis. He was driving like 200 something, and he was very bad with the police. If you do something bad, you have to say you did it. If they come and you are like, ‚Do you know who I am?,‚ they are going to just take everything from you.‚Once, there was huge traffic, and I did something I was not supposed to do, and they of course stopped me. And I said, ‚Yeah, I was wrong. I‚m in a rush, and I have to go to practice.‚ And they said, ‚Go, but don‚t do it again.‚ But I honestly was in a rush.‚ That appears to be Ostapenko‚s default mode on or off the court. There is more than a little Monica Seles in her grip-it-and-rip-it baseline style, and there is more than a little Martina Hingis in her frankness, preternatural self-assurance and varied interests beyond tennis (Hingis rode horseback and skied).‚I‚m the person who always needs to do something,‚ Ostapenko said. ‚It‚s not like nervous energy. It‚s just like because I think when I was younger I didn‚t have so much free time, and I got so used to having everything planned and everything was so close in timing, so I finish something and in 30 minutes I have another practice or another math lesson. So I get bored if there‚s no plan, and I‚m just sitting around.‚Different LooksOn this particular Thursday, shortly after returning to Riga after reaching the final of the Miami Open, she was taking a short break from tennis but still shuttling between boxing and ballroom dancing practices in different parts of the city. Boxing is a new interest, and not just because it provides fine cardio training for her regular job.‚It‚s only my fourth time, but it‚s fun to do something different,‚ she said before donning high-top shoes, shorts and red gloves. She then worked out for an hour, taking no blows from her coach but still flinching when he feigned the start of a roundhouse punch. Her wide-eyed look ‚ Ostapenko is as expressive in a ring as she is in a tennis stadium ‚ sparked a round of laughter from her sizable entourage.‚It‚s really scary sometimes,‚ Ostapenko said of her newest sport. (Golf is next.)Less than an hour later, after taking a wrong turn or two at the wheel and demonstrating her fluency in English expletives, she was changing into a black and red lace dress and high heels to dance with her partner, Daniels Belugins, in a small third-floor studio. ‚Different look,‚ Ostapenko said as her mother, Jelena Jakovleva, and her financial adviser, Ingrida Latimira, watched from a corner of the room.Jakovleva is a highly trained tennis coach with a master‚s degree who played at an elite level when Latvia was part of the Soviet Union. But her initial dream for her only child was not for her to win Wimbledon or Roland Garros.‚I didn‚t want Alona to be a professional tennis player, because I was a pro tennis player, and I know how hard it is,‚ Jakovleva said. ‚When she was 4 years old, we started ballroom dancing. That was my idea, and my dream. It was what I wanted to do, but in the Soviet Union it was not popular.‚And why was it her dream?‚Because it was very nice dresses and very nice movements, nice people, your partners as well,‚ she said. ‚It is like a different life than we had in the Soviet Union.‚Nonetheless, Jakovleva has had to settle for a tennis champion. ‚That‚s all right,‚ she said with a smile.But she has had the chance to watch her daughter dance, and dance very well, for years. Ostapenko did not decide to prioritize tennis until age 12 and said she might have waited longer if the summer dance camp she was eager to attend had had a tennis court nearby.‚So I didn‚t go, and they took away the good dance partner,‚ she said. ‚Every year it was the same issue with these summer camps. It‚s tough to do two things at the highest level.‚ But after a competitive break from dancing between 12 and 18, she continues to practice whenever she returns to Riga. She has two coaches: one for Latin dance and another, the 24-year-old Belugins, for more classical fare like the Viennese waltz.She and Belugins met at the Riga Ball, a formal-dress event in Riga‚s 14th century landmark building, the House of the Blackheads. The ball was started in 2016 in an attempt to revive interest in traditional European dances like the waltz.‚She is a talented girl in many things,‚ Belugins said. ‚When I watched the French Open with my friends, I told the guys that she‚s my partner, and we dance together, and they thought I was kidding, and said, ‚No, I‚ve got videos.‚ So I showed them and they were like, ‚Wow!‚ ‚Ostapenko‚s first tennis competition was in Liepaja, a small coastal city of about 70,000, where her mother and Sevastova grew up. Liepaja is also Porzingis‚s home city and is nearly as famous for being windy. ‚When she was 6, Alona went to visit her grandma in Liepaja and she saw that there was a tournament, and she wanted to take part in it,‚ Jakovleva said. ‚She won one game and then suddenly she saw a cat and she ran away from the court to chase the cat. She lost interest in the tennis.‚ But she would soon return, and under her mother‚s tutelage, develop into one of the game‚s most promising young talents. She won Les Petis As, the prestigious junior tournament in Tarbes, France, at age 13 in 2011 and played in the Australian Open junior event in 2012, racing around the players lounge asking for photographs with stars like Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Victoria Azarenka and Ostapenko‚s personal favorite at the time, Juan Mart√≠n del Potro.Those photos are now on display in her Riga club.‚It was like a field trip for school,‚ she said. ‚All the stars. It‚s funny, because now I see them at almost every tournament that is a combined event.‚ Ostapenko‚s power was there from the start. ‚She was just born like that,‚ Jakovleva said. ‚My job was not to try to destroy what she had from nature. She‚s very flexible and very loose.‚Ostapenko‚s father, Jevgenijs, is Ukrainian and was a goalkeeper for F.C. Metalurh Zaporizhya in southeastern Ukraine.‚She‚s got the genetics from Ukraine,‚ said Jakovleva, who is more slight of build than her daughter and played a more defensive, slice-based game. ‚Her grandfather was quite big and very strong, and her father is quite strong as well.‚Ostapenko‚s serve, which has been her biggest liability as a professional, was once a strength, according to Jakovleva, but deteriorated after a shoulder injury caused her to alter the motion. ‚Up to 15 years old, she was very good in serving,‚ Jakovleva said. ‚It‚s something mental probably now. The pain is gone, but she cannot find the right motion.‚‚I Never Wanted to Leave Riga‚There have been other challenges along the path to the top five, including financial issues. Though she is proudly Latvian, Ostapenko said she had received offers to represent other nations. But Jakovleva said her family was ultimately able to pay the tennis bills through its own savings, funding from friends and other private benefactors, a few commercial sponsors and the International Tennis Federation‚s development fund.Winning Roland Garros, with its first prize of 2.1 million euros ($2.46 million), has certainly increased her budget and her team. She has split from her longtime agent Ugo Colombini, who signed her at 13, to join the huge global agency WME-IMG and agent Max Eisenbud, who also represents Maria Sharapova. Ostapenko has hired the veteran coach David Taylor for 15 weeks this season, just as she worked with the Spanish player Anabel Medina Garrigues on a part-time basis when she won last year‚s French Open.But Jakovleva has remained a central figure, and for Ostapenko, having her mother as primary coach for most of her career has certainly helped the bottom line. She was able to remain based in Riga throughout her teens, unlike Gulbis and Sevastova, who both left Latvia to train at the Niki Pilic Tennis Academy near Munich.‚I never wanted to leave Riga. Never,‚ Ostapenko said. ‚I think I showed everybody you can practice at home and do everything to prepare well for winning good tournaments.‚Jakovleva said she often studied the coaching methods at foreign tennis academies when they were traveling for international competitions. Her conclusion: Her daughter could do just as well or better at home.‚Often there was one good coach in an academy and that coach was already busy with someone else and the other coaches were much lower level, and a lower level than those working in Latvia,‚ Jakovleva said. ‚It was a mix of things. I had this higher education, this master‚s degree as a coach, and I can professionally evaluate how coaches are working. I felt qualified to do that.‚ It also helped that Riga had some genuine indoor courts, unlike Liepaja, where Sevastova‚s only option in the cold months was to play in school gymnasiums with wooden floors and makeshift nets. Those gym floors are covered still today with an intricate pattern of lines of different colors, each color corresponding to a different sport (basketball, volleyball, tennis etc.).‚We played outdoors from May until September, but the other parts of the year it was all in the schools on the wood,‚ said Sevastova, who left for Pilic‚s academy at 15 and is now based near Vienna.Tennis, particularly for girls, is an increasingly popular sport in Latvia, and Ostapenko‚s and Sevastova‚s success is certainly a major factor. Work on a new tennis center in Liepaja, with five indoor courts, is set to begin in July.Before the age of 12, Ostapenko also trained regularly on indoor courts in Riga with an uneven wooden floor, and Jakovleva still coaches a small group of promising juniors in that facility.The drafty spartan gym is quite a contrast to the Enri tennis club, which has couches courtside and cappuccinos at the bar, and even more of a contrast to the center courts of the world where Ostapenko now earns her very good living.‚I really love those big courts,‚ Ostapenko said. ‚But if you turn time back to when I grew up on these wooden courts where the bounce of the ball was unpredictable and very fast and in the winter it was very cold, then I think all those things made me even stronger and a better player.‚ She also thinks those quick, low-bouncing courts shaped her style. ‚Maybe that‚s why I‚m playing aggressive tennis,‚ she said. For some, Ostapenko, fluent in Russian and Latvian, is a unifying figure in a country that regained independence from the Soviet Union only in 1991 and has a large ethnic Russian population.She speaks Russian at home and attended a Russian-language secondary school, graduating near the top of her class, instead of following the common route of many tennis phenoms and opting for home schooling. She and her mother speak Latvian ‚ ‚Like a secret language,‚ Jakovleva said ‚ when they are talking tactics during tournaments and on changeovers during coaching visits on the WTA Tour.‚She‚s a nice icebreaker, especially now with all the Russian things going on,‚ said Kristaps Birmanis, the owner of the Riga design concept store Bold. ‚Her native language is Russian, but she speaks Latvian like normal. I think she respects where she‚s from, the Latvian language and culture.‚Back in her Porsche rolling through Riga, Ostapenko scrolled through the definitively multicultural music on her cellphone with her right hand while holding the steering wheel with her left. The songs were in Spanish, Russian, English and Latvian, and the longer the drive lasted, the more she was interested in singing along. And in hitting the accelerator.‚I hate driving slow,‚ she said with a chuckle. ‚No really, I hate it. So boring.‚",Jelena Ostapenko Returns to the French Open a Hero at Home in Latvia,"May 27, 2018 /  5:37 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-frenchopen-ostapenko/flustered-champion-ostapenko-falls-at-first-french-open-hurdle-idUSKCN1IS0NB,"PARIS (Reuters) - A flustered Jelena Ostapenko became only the sixth female Grand Slam champion to fall at the first hurdle of her title defense on Sunday when she lost to Kateryna Kozlova at the French Open. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 27, 2018   Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko reacts after losing her first round match against Ukraine's Kateryna Kozlova   REUTERS/Pascal RossignolNever at ease on the Roland Garros main show court, the world number five slumped to a 7-5 6-3 defeat to a Ukrainian opponent who had won both the pair’s previous meetings. Not since Anastasia Myskina went down in the opening round of the 2005 tournament has the French Open lost its women’s champion so early, and the 20-year-old slipped off court, her head bowed, ruing what she called a “terrible day”. By losing, Ostapenko joins a ignominious group including, as well as Myskina, Steffi Graf, Jennifer Capriati, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Angelique Kerber who all lost as Grand Slam champions on the first run of their defenses. Kozlova, competing with a large, weeping blister on her heel which caused her to take a medical break at the end of the first set, was well worth the victory, playing with power and composure, in contrast to the flustered champion. “Obviously, it feels great... I didn’t expect anything from the match. I just went to enjoy every moment on the court because, before, I was not sure if I will be able to play in [the] French Open,” Kozlova said, citing a knee injury which had sidelined her. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 27, 2018   Ukraine's Kateryna Kozlova shakes hands with Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko after winning their first round match   REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol“So I was just happy to be on court, back on court, and compete. So it was very important for me. And, in the end, the result comes up and it’s just amazing.” Amazing for Kozlova, dismal for Ostapenko, whose eyes searched the coach’s box at every opportunity. Last year, she had lit up Paris by lifting the title with an exciting, powerful style and smiling, jaunty demeanor. Where in 2017 she made a habit of coming back from the dead to win seemingly lost matches, this year she showed little grit. Slideshow (2 Images)She seemed unable to find any answers to the questions Kozlova was posing, and checked out early with barely a whimper. “It was terrible day,” she told reporters afterwards, her pink cap pulled low over her eyes. “Honestly today began not in a nice way and I knew something like that could happen, so I tried to stay positive. But... “I just woke up here and my mood was not amazing. [A] few things go wrong and you are pissed off, but you try to stay positive. Then you lose a match, and it is no longer possible to be positive.” Ostapenko said she might have had a better chance had she been scheduled on Monday or Tuesday but that it had simply not been her day on Sunday. “When I went on court today I had this unbelievable pressure, and felt I was not myself on court.” “I will just try to forget this as soon as I can.” It might appear lower-ranked players are becoming something of an Achilles’ heel to the Latvian - already this year she had lost to two players outside the world’s top 50. Kozlova, ranked 66, makes it an unhappy hat-trick for the 20-year-old.

More than 2,200 students, alumni and others at USC, one of the most prestigious private U.S. higher education institutions, signed a separate online petition calling for Nikias’ ouster as the campus reeled from its third major personnel scandal since last year. The university has acknowledged failing to properly act on at least eight complaints made against Tyndall between 2000 and 2014. Several former patients filed civil lawsuits during the week and one new accusation lodged in a sworn declaration released on Tuesday dates back to 1991. The university recently brought the situation to the attention of the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, which referred the matter on May 9 to the Los Angeles Police Department “to investigate potential criminal misconduct,” a spokesman for the district attorney’s office said in an email. LAPD spokesman Tony Im said police have no active criminal investigation into the matter. Nikias came under fire last year over accusations of chronic drug abuse by a former USC medical school dean and allegations of sexual harassment by another medical school dean.

Attorney Gloria Allred listens as her client, Danielle Mohazab, speaks about an alleged incident during a 2016 exam with University of Southern California (USC) gynecologist Dr. George Tyndall at the schools Health Center during a news conference in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 22, 2018.  REUTERS/Mike BlakeThe agency’s Office for Civil Rights will examine USC’s response to reports of such misconduct by Dr. George Tyndall that date back to 1990 but were not fully investigated by the university until the spring of 2016, the department said in a statement. “No student should ever endure sexual harassment or abuse while trying to pursue their education,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in the statement. The university has acknowledged failing to properly act on at least eight complaints that were lodged against Tyndall between 2000 and 2014 but were never brought to light until they were uncovered during the course of an inquiry USC finally opened in 2016. Tyndall was suspended at that time, and was allowed to quietly resign in 2017 after USC’s inquiry concluded that his pelvic examination practices were beyond accepted medical standards and that he had harassed patients. Disclosure that the university chose not to immediately report Tyndall to the state medical board, doing so only eight months later when he sought reinstatement, sparked a huge outcry from students, faculty and alumni. The furor led university President C.L. Max Nikias to resign after nearly eight years as head of one of the most prestigious private institutions of higher education in the United States. His ouster came as USC faced a mounting tide of civil litigation accusing Tyndall of misconduct and the university of complicity and negligence, as well as a criminal investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department. LAPD detectives said last month they were investigating 52 complaints filed by former patients of Tyndall, alleging incidents of misconduct from 1990 to 2016. In addition, a USC hotline and special website has received more than 400 reports from concerned patients, the Los Angeles Times said. Tyndall, 71, could not be reached for comment by Reuters but has denied any wrongdoing in interviews with the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the scandal. The Education Department probe will look at whether the university’s handling of the matter constituted a civil rights violation under Title IX of federal education statutes barring sex discrimination.

The latest developments came after an international team of investigators said on Thursday that the missile that brought down the plane as it passed over Ukraine had originated with an active duty Russian military unit, the 53rd Antiaircraft Brigade. Among the 298 people on board the jet were 196 Dutch citizens and more than three dozen citizens and residents of Australia.The missile was brought into eastern Ukraine in July 2014, when Ukrainian forces were inflicting losses on Russia-backed rebels, the investigators said.‚Based on these findings, the only conclusion we can reasonably now draw is that Russia was directly involved in the downing of MH17,‚ the Australian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.The conclusions were in line with a finding in 2015 by the Dutch Safety Board, an investigating body, that the plane had been destroyed by a missile known as a Buk, but went further in identifying the role of a Russian military unit.‚The government is now taking the next step by formally holding Russia accountable,‚ the Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, said in The Hague, although the authorities were quick to note that such a task would be difficult. In a statement, the Dutch cabinet acknowledged that ‚holding a country responsible is a complex legal process.‚ But, the statement added, ‚This is the legal avenue that the Netherlands and Australia have now chosen to pursue.‚Russia has repeatedly rejected the charges and has long insisted that it had no part in the shooting down of the plane. On Friday, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said that Russia ‚absolutely‚ denied involvement.The investigators refrained from blaming Russian soldiers directly for firing the missile, which could have been launched by Ukrainian separatists.Debris from the attack ‚ the worst single act of bloodletting during the now four-year-old Ukraine war ‚ was strewn over a wide area. Dutch and Australian emergency workers found missile fragments and detritus from the Boeing 777 that were later used to identify the weapon.The plan by the Dutch and Australian authorities comes as Moscow is trying to cope with onerous sanctions imposed as punishment for annexing Crimea, its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine and meddling in the United States presidential election.The role played by President Vladimir V. Putin in supporting President Bashar al-Assad in Syria against Western-backed rebels has also set Moscow against the West in a multifaceted confrontation that has prompted some Westerners to speak of a new Cold War.Separately on Friday, Bellingcat, an investigative group that conducts research with open-source information, said it had identified a second high-ranking Russian military intelligence commander said to have been active in eastern Ukraine at the time the plane was brought down. The group, which includes professional journalists in Moscow and Washington, identified the officer as Oleg V. Ivannikov, and said he operated under the pseudonym Andrei I. Laptev and the code name Orion.Part of his job in eastern Ukraine in 2014 was to supervise ‚the procurement and transport of weapons across the Russia-Ukraine border,‚ Bellingcat said. ‚He held these functions at the time of the downing‚ of the Malaysian airliner, it said.According to a report by the same group in December, the person code-named Orion was heard in a telephone intercept discussing the movement of military equipment with another Russian, who had the code name Delfin. The group identified Delfin as a semiretired Russian three-star general, Nikolai F. Tkachev.","Russia ‚ÄòAccountable‚Äô for Downed Airliner, Australia and Netherlands Say","May 25, 2018 /  8:36 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-cabinet/netherlands-australia-hold-russia-responsible-in-mh17-downing-idUSKCN1IQ0XO,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Netherlands told Moscow on Friday it will hold the Russian state legally responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014, after investigators concluded that a Russian army missile system was used in the attack.

A team of international investigators said on Thursday that the “Buk” missile system used to bring down the passenger plane came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade, based in the western Russian city of Kursk. “It is the first time the finger points to one specific   country,” Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters after an emergency cabinet meeting. “We are holding Russia responsible for their role in the deployment of the Buk rocket system.” The diplomatic escalation comes at a time when relations between Western powers and Russia have reached their lowest point in decades.

The Netherlands and Australia informed Moscow that it expects Russia to now provide full assistance to the investigation, which is in the final stage of identifying perpetrators to be tried under Dutch law. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Washington supported the decisions by the Netherlands and Australia “to hold Russia to account.” FILE PHOTO: A damaged missile is displayed during a news conference by members of the Joint Investigation Team, comprising the authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine who present interim results in the ongoing investigation of the 2014 MH17 crash that killed 298 people over eastern Ukraine, in Bunnik, Netherlands, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo“It is time for Russia to acknowledge its role in the shooting down of MH-17 and to cease its callous disinformation campaign,” she said. Russia has always denied any involvement, and said on Thursday none of its missile launchers had ever entered Ukraine, despite photographic evidence presented by prosecutors. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday his Dutch counterpart had been unable to provide evidence of Russia’s involvement in the crash, the Russian TASS news agency reported. Rutte declined to specify what steps would follow if Moscow continued to fail to cooperate. The speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, was quoted by the TASS Russian news agency as saying on Friday that Russia was prepared for everything, including new sanctions. Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the Netherlands and Australia would seek unspecified financial damages. Blok said that attempts to hold Russia responsible for the plane’s downing under international law would be a different, parallel process from the ongoing investigation by prosecutors seeking to establish individual criminal responsibility. Russia is already under U.S. and European sanctions over its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. More recently, dozens of countries have expelled Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain which accused Moscow of using a nerve agent to poison an ex-spy and his daughter in an English city in March. The United States has tightened sanctions this year after accusing Russia of meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia denies all of the Western accusations against it and says it is the target of a propaganda campaign.

Bean, 86, a former U.S. Navy test pilot who became one of only 12 people ever to set foot on the moon, died at Houston Methodist Hospital, his family said in a statement released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). He had fallen ill two weeks ago while traveling in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  “Alan was the strongest and kindest man I ever knew. He was the love of my life and I miss him dearly,” said Leslie Bean, Bean’s wife of 40 years, in a statement. “A native Texan, Alan died peacefully in Houston surrounded by those who loved him.” Leaving his footprints on a region called the Ocean of Storms, Bean in November 1969 became the fourth man to walk on the moon as one of the astronauts on the second of NASA’s lunar landing missions, Apollo 12. For the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11’s moon landing, Bean exhibited his paintings of lunar scenes at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum in Washington. Bean’s lunar quest came just four months after American Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon in NASA’s historic Apollo 11 mission in July 1969. Bean served as lunar module pilot on Apollo 12. He and crew mate Pete Conrad explored the moon’s surface and conducted experiments while Richard Gordon orbited overhead in the command module, scouting landing sites for future moon missions. “I remember once looking back at Earth and starting to think, ‘Gee, that’s beautiful.’ Then I said to myself, ‘Quit screwing off and go collect rocks.’ We figured reflection wasn’t productive,” Bean told People magazine in 1981. The mission was a success, even though it started with a jolt. Shortly after liftoff, the rocket was struck by lightning but the crew was able to continue the three-day flight to the moon. Bean and Conrad spent more than 31 hours on the lunar surface, including more than seven hours working outside of the module. In 1973, Bean commanded the second mission to Skylab, the first U.S. space station. Along with crew mates Owen Garriott and Jack Lousma, he spent 59 days in low-Earth orbit. Bean later played a key role in preparing future astronauts, serving in that role until the first flight of the space shuttle in 1981. He even worked with “Star Trek” actress Nichelle Nichols on outreach efforts to prospective astronauts.

Bean, who was the fourth man to walk on the moon in 1969, left NASA in 1981 and made a successful transition from spaceman to a full-time professional artist.  REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo‘LIVE YOUR DREAM’ His decision in 1981 to give up his NASA career to become a full-time artist surprised some of his colleagues. “You have to live your dream even if other people think it’s screwed up,” Bean told a 2010 NASA oral history interview. “About half the astronauts thought it was a midlife crisis or something. The other half, the ones that were more right-brain, thought it was a pretty good idea.” Bean remembered telling a senior NASA official named George Abbey the reason he was leaving the space agency. “I said, ‘I’m going to be an artist,’” Bean recalled. “If he hadn’t had the window behind him, he would have gone over backwards. ... His first comment: ‘Can you earn a living at that?’ ... I said, ‘I don’t know, but if I can’t I’m going to go to work at Jack in the Box (the fast-food hamburger chain).” Working at his home in Houston, Bean created paintings that focused on the Apollo missions, with images of himself and other astronauts on the moon rendered with the authenticity in lighting and color that only an eyewitness could provide. His paintings sold for tens of thousands of dollars apiece. His former colleagues became admirers. Armstrong once said, “Alan Bean and his ‘astroartistry’ recreate the drama and excitement of man’s exploration of the moon as only could be chronicled by one who has been there.” “I think I would like to be remembered in the end as an astronaut and an artist,” Bean told People. “I think everyone can do more than one thing with his life.” Bean was born on March 15, 1932, in Wheeler, Texas, and grew up in Fort Worth. He aspired to become a pilot and started flight training at age 17. He earned a degree in aeronautical engineering at the University of Texas, then was commissioned as an officer in the Navy.

The party and allied groups are spending more than $4 million on just three campaigns, intervening in one contest to prop up a favored candidate; attacking a Republican from the right in another; and even reminding people not to waste their votes on ‚ghost candidates‚ who have dropped out yet remain on the ballot.As any progressive activist will explain through gnashed teeth, the head-snapping scramble is because of the state‚s ‚top two‚ open primary system, which allows the two leading vote-getters ‚ regardless of political parties ‚ to advance to the general election. The ‚top two‚ system was meant to create incentives for political moderation in a state where about a quarter of the voters are independents, but it has created immense stakes for Democrats: They need to win 23 seats to take back the House, and party officials believe the path runs through the seven competitive California districts, all of which Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.[Read more on how California‚s ‚top two‚ system works.]‚It‚s a disaster,‚ Gail Reisman, a retired gerontologist and Toronto native who lives in Representative Dana Rohrabacher‚s district, said after attending a candidate forum Tuesday. ‚If we have two Republicans running I think I‚m going back to Canada.‚After three of the Democrats opposing Mr. Rohrabacher had taken a turn speaking at the forum, held at a synagogue, the moderator briefly came back on stage to alert the audience that the parking lot was so crowded the police intended to ticket those cars parked more creatively than legally.The overflow of Priuses and Mercedes was a particularly vivid reminder of the California candidate logjam. Confusion and frustration among Democrats here only seems to grow by the day, as the state and national party back different contenders and spending sprays forth like an out-of-control garden hose. Some voters are not sure who to back to feel confident that a Democrat will advance past June 5, and they increasingly worry that Republicans will foil the party‚s chances to stop President Trump‚s agenda in the House next year.The painful twist is that what seemed like the Democrats‚ most valuable asset in the midterm campaign ‚ the wave of liberal activism unleashed by President Trump ‚ has metastasized into a mortal threat because of the glut of candidates. Nowhere is the danger more acute than in a pair of contiguous districts that stretch from Orange County‚s Seal Beach down the Pacific coastline to the cliffs of La Jolla.It is here where national Democrats, deeply concerned their voters are scattered among little-known House candidates, are staging a rescue mission to ensure they are not locked out this fall in Mr. Rohrabacher‚s district and the one farther south held by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican who is retiring.Opposition research and hard-edge direct mail pieces are flying between candidates, too, some of them tinged with accusations of #MeToo impropriety. But surveys show many of the candidates bunched together in the teens and few operatives have a firm grasp for what will unfold. Actual policy issues are largely secondary: The differences between the Democratic hopefuls are a matter of degree, with all of them vowing a progressive agenda on health care, the environment and gun control while taking aim at Mr. Trump. The Republicans are focused on gains in the economy, a gas tax repeal measure and warning the largely moderate and center-right voters in the districts that Democrats are turning sharply to the left.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party‚s arm in House races, is most concerned that two Republicans might prevail in the primary for Mr. Rohrabacher‚s seat. The committee has broken with the state Democratic Party to endorse a candidate, Harley Rouda.Meanwhile, the main House Democratic ‚super PAC‚ is pouring over $600,000 into commercials in the Los Angeles market, which reaches 27 congressional districts, to try to drive down Republican candidate Scott Baugh‚s share of the vote against Mr. Rohrabacher, in hopes that a Democrat can finish in the top two and face the incumbent in November. [Read more: The Rev.

(Reuters) - As Californians prepare to go to the polls on Tuesday to choose candidates in primary elections, the state’s quirky electoral rules and a softening of support for Democrats among suburban voters could disrupt the party’s ambitious plan to wrest as many as 10 seats from Republicans in California.  November’s general election could change the balance of power in the U.S. Congress, where Republicans control both chambers. Democrats need to win 23 seats nationwide to have a majority in the House of Representatives, considered a very real possibility. Most of California’s congressional districts did not go for the Republican Party’s leader, Donald Trump, in the 2016 presidential election.  “It’s the first time in years that California elections have mattered in national politics,” said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University Los Angeles. “The House races are critically important.” Voters on Tuesday will also be choosing candidates to run in next November’s election in primaries in New Jersey, Mississippi, Alabama, Iowa, Montana, South Dakota and New Mexico. The California Republican party’s biggest problem is a continuing decline across the state that began decades ago.    For the first time, the number of registered voters who are Republicans slipped below the number of independents, leaving the party in third place, said Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data www.politicaldata.com, which analyzed registration information from the state this week.  But that decline does not give the Democratic Party an easy win on Tuesday. The party has its own challenges. If voters select Democratic candidates who are too progressive for conservative areas of California, it might prove difficult for Democrats to win in November. Yet if more moderate candidates win in the primaries, fired-up progressives may decide not to vote in November, leaving more room for Republicans to win. ""The Democrats have their work cut out for them,"" said Mark Baldassare, who runs the Public Policy Institute of California www.ppic.org, a polling and public policy think tank. ""Some of the exuberance about Democrats taking this over has maybe gotten a little bit ahead of itself.""  So many enthusiastic newcomers have tossed their hats in the ring in an effort to unseat vulnerable incumbent Republicans or to claim seats vacated by resigning Republicans that they may simply divide the anti-Trump vote among themselves.  That dilution of the vote matters more in California because of its so-called jungle primary. It does not hold separate party primaries. Instead, the top two vote-getters advance to the general election regardless of party. For example, in the 48th Congressional District, which includes affluent coastal towns between Los Angeles and San Diego, 16 candidates will appear on Tuesday’s ballot. Five Republicans, eight Democrats, a Libertarian and an independent have filed papers to challenge Republican Representative Dana Rohrbacher. One of the Republican challengers, former State Assemblyman Scott Baugh, is considered well known enough to possibly make it into the second position after Rohrabacher, a situation that would lock Democrats out of the race. Key to the Democrats’ efforts is suburban Orange County south of Los Angeles, where four congressional districts were once the heart of rock-ribbed California Republicanism. In all four districts, some of which include parts of San Diego and Los Angeles counties, voters in 2016 chose Hillary Clinton over Trump for president, but returned Republicans to Congress. Two representatives, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce, chose not to run for re-election this year. Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters are seeking re-election in competitive races. Many voters in those districts are affluent and suburban, a group that has been leaning toward choosing Democrats for Congress in November, according to recent Reuters polling. Orange County is more ethnically diverse than in the past, a change that generally leads to more support for Democrats. But Reuters/Ipsos polling over four weeks in May shows a softening at the national level of support for Democrats for Congress among suburban voters. And the Public Policy Institute's May survey of likely voters showed that most likely voters in the 10 Republican-held California districts viewed as very close by the Cook Political Report here were supporting Republicans for Congress. State Republican Party Chairman Jim Brulte said the polls and a strong presence in early voting indicate Republicans in the state are becoming more engaged as the election approaches, possibly alleviating a so-called enthusiasm gap he had feared would keep Republican voters at home.  “Based on what we’re seeing now, my concerns have been allayed,” Brulte said.   Absentee ballots received so far show Republicans punching above their weight, accounting for 34 percent of ballots returned even though they only amount to 26 percent of registered voters, according to Political Data.

The party and allied groups are spending more than $4 million on just three campaigns, intervening in one contest to prop up a favored candidate; attacking a Republican from the right in another; and even reminding people not to waste their votes on ‚ghost candidates‚ who have dropped out yet remain on the ballot.As any progressive activist will explain through gnashed teeth, the head-snapping scramble is because of the state‚s ‚top two‚ open primary system, which allows the two leading vote-getters ‚ regardless of political parties ‚ to advance to the general election. The ‚top two‚ system was meant to create incentives for political moderation in a state where about a quarter of the voters are independents, but it has created immense stakes for Democrats: They need to win 23 seats to take back the House, and party officials believe the path runs through the seven competitive California districts, all of which Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.[Read more on how California‚s ‚top two‚ system works.]‚It‚s a disaster,‚ Gail Reisman, a retired gerontologist and Toronto native who lives in Representative Dana Rohrabacher‚s district, said after attending a candidate forum Tuesday. ‚If we have two Republicans running I think I‚m going back to Canada.‚After three of the Democrats opposing Mr. Rohrabacher had taken a turn speaking at the forum, held at a synagogue, the moderator briefly came back on stage to alert the audience that the parking lot was so crowded the police intended to ticket those cars parked more creatively than legally.The overflow of Priuses and Mercedes was a particularly vivid reminder of the California candidate logjam. Confusion and frustration among Democrats here only seems to grow by the day, as the state and national party back different contenders and spending sprays forth like an out-of-control garden hose. Some voters are not sure who to back to feel confident that a Democrat will advance past June 5, and they increasingly worry that Republicans will foil the party‚s chances to stop President Trump‚s agenda in the House next year.The painful twist is that what seemed like the Democrats‚ most valuable asset in the midterm campaign ‚ the wave of liberal activism unleashed by President Trump ‚ has metastasized into a mortal threat because of the glut of candidates. Nowhere is the danger more acute than in a pair of contiguous districts that stretch from Orange County‚s Seal Beach down the Pacific coastline to the cliffs of La Jolla.It is here where national Democrats, deeply concerned their voters are scattered among little-known House candidates, are staging a rescue mission to ensure they are not locked out this fall in Mr. Rohrabacher‚s district and the one farther south held by Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican who is retiring.Opposition research and hard-edge direct mail pieces are flying between candidates, too, some of them tinged with accusations of #MeToo impropriety. But surveys show many of the candidates bunched together in the teens and few operatives have a firm grasp for what will unfold. Actual policy issues are largely secondary: The differences between the Democratic hopefuls are a matter of degree, with all of them vowing a progressive agenda on health care, the environment and gun control while taking aim at Mr. Trump. The Republicans are focused on gains in the economy, a gas tax repeal measure and warning the largely moderate and center-right voters in the districts that Democrats are turning sharply to the left.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party‚s arm in House races, is most concerned that two Republicans might prevail in the primary for Mr. Rohrabacher‚s seat. The committee has broken with the state Democratic Party to endorse a candidate, Harley Rouda.Meanwhile, the main House Democratic ‚super PAC‚ is pouring over $600,000 into commercials in the Los Angeles market, which reaches 27 congressional districts, to try to drive down Republican candidate Scott Baugh‚s share of the vote against Mr. Rohrabacher, in hopes that a Democrat can finish in the top two and face the incumbent in November.

But in the states most crucial to the party’s future, they face grim odds, a Reuters analysis of election data has found. Strategists with Forward Majority, an independent Democratic political action committee focused on state legislatures and state party operatives, discuss their prospects of breaking Republican control in a critical state legislature during the November midterm elections in Tampa, Florida, U.S., May 14, 2018.  Picture taken May 14, 2018.  REUTERS/Letitia SteinIn many states, Democrats’ only hope lies in flipping numerous districts that two years ago voted for Republicans in both the presidential and state legislative elections. The problem is especially daunting for Democrats in battleground states where congressional district lines favoring Republicans were drawn after the 2010 census, Reuters’ analysis found. Those lines will be redrawn after the next census in 2020, and in most states the party in power will control how districts are reshaped. “When a single party has control of the process, the maps are less fair,” said Michael Li, senior counsel at the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice and author of a report examining how the party in power draws electoral maps to its partisan advantage, a contentious practice called gerrymandering. Large swing states, he notes, “are the ones where it is easiest to engineer an outsized advantage.” Currently, Republicans hold two-thirds of state legislative chambers and governorships. They completely control many crucial states, including Florida, Michigan and Ohio. This year, Democrats have announced a campaign to “flip everything,” citing the importance of retaking state legislatures in advance of redistricting. Democratic Party groups and aligned political committees expect to spend tens of millions of dollars trying to win back legislative seats and governorships. The effort, the party says, has importance beyond redistricting. States enact voting laws that can discourage turnout, and they have played a key role in promoting or resisting policies set by Republican President Donald Trump on issues such as abortion, gay rights and health care. “When we win back state legislatures, we can resist Trump’s agenda and enact America’s agenda,” says Democratic U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a rising star in his party, in a video promoting its efforts.  Reuters GraphicA NUMBERS GAME To assess the Democrats’ chances, Reuters examined election data from 10 states where Republicans control legislatures considered key in redistricting: Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. Republican-engineered boundaries in some of those states are responsible for much of the party’s numerical advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, according to the Brennan Center. Many of the states also are pivotal in determining the outcome of presidential elections. Reuters analyzed 2016 election results from more than 1,500 legislative districts in the states to identify districts where voters backed Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump in the presidential contest but also have Republican state representatives. Both parties see such districts as having the potential to be flipped based on recent elections in Virginia and elsewhere, and are focusing considerable attention on them. In most of the states, however, even if every one of the Clinton-supporting districts elected a Democratic state lawmaker in November, the legislature would still have a Republican majority. Of the states reviewed, only Minnesota has enough Clinton-won Republican districts to flip a legislative chamber if they all went for Democrats in November. Pennsylvania would fall one short. “The planets would have to align perfectly” for Democrats to retake control of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, said Nathan Davidson, executive director of the chamber’s Democratic campaign committee. Elsewhere, the outlook is even more challenging. In Ohio, for example, on top of flipping the seven Republican districts Clinton won in 2016, Democrats would need to convert at least 10 additional House seats in districts that went for Trump in the last election. Despite their public optimism, Democrats acknowledge the tough road ahead. “The path to a majority has to run through seats that Secretary Clinton did not win, that is the reality,” said Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s national statehouse coordinator. Factors beyond presidential performance may give Democrats more hope, she noted, such as past election patterns and voter enthusiasm. Even if Democrats cannot flip key legislatures this year, Post said the party aims to make significant gains for a better shot at clinching majorities in 2020 before redistricting. Democratic leaders also say a wave is possible given the party’s recent special election wins in Trump territory and unexpectedly big gains last fall in Virginia, which unlike most places holds its statehouse elections in odd-numbered years. In that election, Democrats nearly erased a 2-to-1 Republican legislative majority. But Virginia also demonstrated the party’s hurdles. Of the 15 seats flipped in the state, only one was in a district that went for Trump. Democrats “are irrationally exuberant in their hopes this cycle,” said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee. EXPANDING THE MAP Some Democrats hope the influence of state legislatures on redistricting could be diluted by anti-gerrymandering ballot initiatives. The U.S. Supreme Court is also weighing two cases challenging partisan manipulation of district boundaries in Wisconsin and Maryland. A ruling, expected soon, could impose limits on gerrymandering or let it continue unchecked. Groups like Forward Majority, a political action committee working to elect Democrats in state legislative races, aren’t waiting for courts to act. Forward Majority believes the party could see a wave this fall, but only if it competes hard, even in districts that seem like long shots. “It’s worth it to fight everywhere,” says the group’s campaigns director Ethan Roeder. The group’s analysis, shared exclusively with Reuters, pegs Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania as prime targets for Democratic flips. In a significant wave, Forward Majority says, Democrats might even win back a legislative chamber in both North Carolina and Texas. The group advocates a more ambitious strategy of targeting dozens of districts where Clinton was competitive in 2016 but fell short, or where Democrats previously did well. It plans to take an active role in races where Democrats lack other resources to compete. Actually turning the tide remains difficult, however, Reuters’ analysis found. In the Florida House, for example, Democrats would need to win more than a dozen seats currently held by Republicans in districts that went for Clinton in 2016 - plus pick up five more.

Mr. Heikensten told the national broadcaster Sveriges Radio that the prize ‚will be awarded when the Swedish Academy has won back the public‚s trust ‚ and that means there is no deadline for 2019.‚Without naming names, he also urged the 10 remaining active members in the academy to consider leaving their seats.‚I think everyone needs to think about whether they are good for the Swedish Academy and the Nobel Prize and whether they will be good for the academy in the future, or is it better to step down.‚The Nobel Foundation administrates the funds for the prizes, but the will of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor, appointed the Swedish Academy as arbiter of the literature award.Mr. Heikensten said if the academy cannot resolve its problems, the Nobel Foundation could appoint a new institution to administer the world‚s most prestigious cultural prize, a measure that would require a further amendment in the statutes. ‚There are many who are ready to step in,‚ he said.But addressing the idea of finding another institution to take over the literary prize, Per Wastberg, a member, said, ‚That is not possible, according to Alfred Nobel‚s will and the law.‚The back-and-forth comments came at the end of a week of public squabbling among academy members and months of tortured drama prompted by a sexual misconduct scandal that has decimated the Swedish Academy.In November, the newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that 18 women had accused Claude Arnault, a cultural impresario with close ties to the academy, of abuse and sexual harassment.Together with his wife, Katarina Frostenson, a poet and a member of the Swedish Academy, Mr. Arnault ran Forum, a successful cultural club that featured literary readings, concerts and exhibitions and that had received financial support from the academy for decades.Mr. Arnault, a photographer, was accused of using his close ties to the cultural elite to commit sexual misconduct, particularly against aspiring writers and artists. Much of the alleged abuse is said to have taken place at academy-owned apartments in Stockholm and Paris.Through his lawyer, Mr. Arnault has denied all charges, some of which are still under police investigation.In response to these revelations, Ms. Danius, then the academy‚s permanent secretary, cut all ties with Mr. Arnault and Forum and convened an independent investigation into the academy‚s ties to the club. After the investigation, three academy members left the academy in disgust. They had demanded that Ms. Frostenson, Mr. Arnault‚s wife, leave her position, but another faction in the group wanted her to stay.Ms. Danius was ousted from her role as permanent secretary, then left the academy altogether.Although the appointments to the academy are for life, an unusual intervention by the Swedish king, the academy‚s protector, made it possible for members to leave the academy voluntarily.In his radio interview, Mr. Heikensten said this was an opportunity to review the academy‚s rules and to make it more transparent. ‚I‚m not sure that it should be a life term,‚ he said of membership.Only 10 of the 18 original members remain, putting the academy two people short of the 12-member quorum required to vote in new members. Four were allowed to leave their seats, and four others are not participating in the academy‚s work for the time being.The Swedish Academy has hired a mediator to help resolve this situation, Mr. Heikensten said.","Once Delayed, Nobel Prize for Literature No Sure Thing in 2019","June 12, 2018 /  12:22 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nobel-prize-charges/man-at-center-of-nobel-literature-scandal-charged-with-rape-idUSKBN1J81HH,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Swedish state prosecutor has brought two charges of rape against the man at the center of a scandal that forced the Swedish Academy to cancel the award of the Nobel Prize for literature in 2018, the prosecutor said on Tuesday. Late last year, 18 women accused photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, who is married to a member of the Academy, of sexual harassment and assault, leading to a preliminary investigation by state prosecutors. District prosecutor Christina Voigt said on Tuesday that Arnault had been charged with two counts of rape against a woman in Stockholm in 2011. “My view is that the evidence is solid and sufficient for charges to be brought,” Voigt said in a statement. Arnault denies the allegations, as well as separate allegations that he was responsible for leaking the names of some prize-winners ahead of the official announcement. “He maintains that he is completely innocent of the allegations,” Bjorn Hurtig, Arnault’s lawyer, told Reuters on Tuesday. “I do not share the prosecutor’s view that the evidence is robust. Accounts differ, there is no technical evidence, there are no direct witness accounts and the events are a long time in the past.” Prosecutors closed another preliminary investigation into a number of the abuse allegations against Arnault in March, citing insufficient evidence and because for some the statute of limitations had expired.  Several members of the Academy have resigned over how the institution, one of Sweden’s most prestigious, handled its own investigation into the allegations against Arnault.

You could feel it from courtside on Tuesday as she tried to impose her will on the few baseline rallies in a match that was more often a big serving duel. You could hear it as she growled chasing down shots in the corners or sprinted forward for drop shots, once falling to the red clay near the net as she hustled.It was far from flawless tennis, but it was routinely intense and combative. And the bold, form-fitting black bodysuit that she wore was a nod to both her illustrious past and to her new circumstances.It was reminiscent of the black catsuit she wore at the 2002 United States Open en route to winning four major singles titles in a row, the so-called Serena Slam. It was also a sartorial shout-out to mothers far beyond Roland Garros.‚It feels like this suit represents all the women that have been through a lot mentally, physically with their body to come back and have confidence and to believe in themselves,‚ said Williams, who indicated that the suit‚s compressive qualities also had a functional role in light of her recurring problems with blood clots, because it facilitated circulation. Williams, 36, gave birth to her daughter, Olympia, last September after a cesarean section that led to life-threatening complications, which made returning to the court more of an ordeal than it has been for some other new mothers on the WTA Tour. After Williams made two brief and ultimately underwhelming comeback appearances in March at the BNP Paribas Open and the Miami Open, she decided to take more time off to regroup and get fitter.Her match on Tuesday was her first in a Grand Slam tournament in nearly 16 months.

Of the surfaces used in professional tennis, it is the most specific in terms of movement, the one on which it is most difficult to change direction.

Mouratoglou told her that in his view it was ‚not all reasonable‚ to play either one.‚Me personally, I prefer a Serena who is ready in terms of her fitness and her tennis even with no matches under her belt than a Serena who is not truly ready with some matches under her belt,‚ Mouratoglou said on Tuesday night. ‚I think that first combination is a lot more powerful than the second one.‚ It is, however, highly unconventional. ‚No matches on clay, that‚s wild,‚ said Chris Evert, the seven-time French Open champion. ‚She is so fearless.‚Winning Roland Garros is tough enough with clay-court preparation, but Mouratoglou said Williams began to cry when they agreed on the decision to skip Madrid and Rome.He said both of them were trying to learn from the mistake of playing too early in Indian Wells, where she lost in the third round to her sister Venus Williams, and in Miami, where she was convincingly beaten in the first round by Naomi Osaka.‚I did not tell her that I disagreed with her playing in Indian Wells and Miami at the time, which was a mistake on my part,‚ Mouratoglou said. ‚It‚s always complicated with Serena, because she can surprise you so much. She‚s so often capable of doing things that normally she should not be able to do that you always have that in the back of your mind that if she believes, really believes, then she is capable of doing it even if she is not ready.‚‚But in hindsight,‚ he continued, ‚it was a dumb move, because she also was taking the risk of getting hurt. When you‚re not ready physically and you‚re really carrying too much weight, it‚s dangerous.‚The keys, in Mouratoglou‚s view, were not to make the same error again and also to convince Williams that she needed to leave her home in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and come to his academy in order to optimize her training. They had a tough conversation, which was included in the documentary series ‚Being Serena,‚ currently on HBO. Williams was not eager to leave the United States and her husband, Alexis Ohanian, for any longer than necessary.But she ultimately came with Olympia in tow.‚I asked her to come because I knew it would help, and it helped her incredibly because she completely concentrated on tennis for the month,‚ Mouratoglou said. ‚And I saw her work like I rarely have seen her work.‚ Mouratoglou said Williams had done twice-a-day cardio sessions on machines so there was no risk of injury. He said he and his team had reintroduced tennis on a gradual basis.‚First without moving to the ball but with a big intensity in the hitting, so again no risk,‚ he said. ‚When she was more ready, we started to bring in movement that she could anticipate, but no surprises or wrong-footing her.

She has played just two events since she first returned to the Tour in March. “Pregnancy is very hard to (come back from),” Clijsters told Reuters in an interview. “Everything is a lot looser, it takes time to get that back to where it once was.  “I remember doing an interview when Serena was pregnant and people were asking me constantly, do you think she can do it? My thing was, you don’t know how your body will react, how you will react emotionally. “I admire both Serena and Venus because they have a perseverance that is incredible. They’re able to do a lot of things that other people can’t do, physically and mentally, so I don’t doubt that she will come back, I don’t doubt it, but it just takes a little bit of time.” Clijsters, who is working as an expert summariser for Eurosport and Eurosport Player, who will be broadcasting Roland Garros from May 27 to June 10, retired from tennis in 2007. She returned to the sport in 2009, a year and a half after having her first child, Jada.

Clijsters said getting back into the old routine may have had a rejuvenating effect on Williams. “Every body reacts differently,” she said, of the physical demands.  “Having a baby is emotional and physically very draining – at times you’re on a high, at times you’re low. “I fell in love all over again with the sport and I enjoyed taking those few hours off from home to go and work out and play tennis, because I needed it, for various reasons, not just because I wanted to get back into shape. “I’d just lost my father at the start of 2009 and for me it was a mindset, to get away from it and just focus on tennis. Then I would come home, I’d be with Jada, we’d do family things and I felt like my balance was good and I needed it.” Williams will play Kristyna Pliskova of the Czech Republic in the first round in Paris and could face her old foe, Maria Sharapova, in the last 16.

The case will continue to be litigated in the lower courts.The law concerns medication abortions, which use pills to induce abortions in the first nine weeks of pregnancy. The law, enacted in 2015, requires providers of the procedure to have contracts with doctors who have admitting privileges at a hospital in the state. Abortion clinics in Arkansas said they were unable to find any doctors willing to sign such contracts.After the Supreme Court‚s action, Planned Parenthood said it would for now stop providing medication abortions in the state. ‚Arkansas is now shamefully responsible for being the first state to ban medication abortion,‚ said Dawn Laguens, the group‚s executive vice president. ‚This dangerous law immediately ends access to safe, legal abortion at all but one health center in the state.‚Leslie Rutledge, the Arkansas attorney general, said she welcomed the court‚s decision not to hear the case.‚I have fully defended this law at every turn and applaud the Supreme Court‚s decision against Planned Parenthood,‚ she said. ‚Protecting the health and well-being of women and the unborn will always be a priority.‚In 2016, Judge Kristine G. Baker, of the Federal District Court in Little Rock, blocked the Arkansas law, saying its medical benefits were few at best and outweighed by the burdens it imposed. The law, she wrote, quoting an earlier decision, was ‚a solution in search of a problem.‚But a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, vacated that decision, saying that Judge Baker had not specified how many women would be affected. The court suspended its ruling while challengers sought Supreme Court review. Judge Baker has yet to make the findings requested by the appeals court. Once she does, further appeals are likely. Planned Parenthood said it would again ask Judge Baker to block the law while the case moves forward.Arkansas has three abortion clinics. One, in Little Rock, offers both medication and surgical abortions. The others, in Little Rock and Fayetteville, offer only medication abortions.In its appeal to the Supreme Court, the local Planned Parenthood affiliate said it contacted every qualified doctor it could identify. None of them, the group said, was willing to enter into the contract required by the law. This was unsurprising, Judge Baker found, as doctors in Arkansas who perform abortions ‚risk being ostracized from their communities and face harassment and violence toward themselves, their family, and their private practices.‚Arkansas officials told the Supreme Court that Planned Parenthood had not tried hard enough or told the doctors how much it was willing to pay.If the law were to go into effect, Planned Parenthood told the justices, only surgical abortions would be available in Arkansas. ‚This will particularly affect women who strongly prefer medication abortion,‚ the group told the Supreme Court, ‚including those who find it traumatic to have instruments placed in their vaginas because they are victims of rape, incest, or domestic violence, as well as women for whom medication abortion is medically indicated and safer than surgical abortion.‚In their Supreme Court brief in the case, Planned Parenthood of Arkansas & Eastern Oklahoma v. Jegley, No. 17-935, Arkansas officials responded that ‚there is no right to choose medication abortion.‚The Arkansas law is quite similar to one in Texas that was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016.Writing for the majority in the 5-3 decision, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the Texas law, which required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, placed ‚a substantial obstacle‚ in the path of women seeking abortions and amounted to an ‚undue burden on abortion access‚ in violation of the Constitution. Judges considering laws restricting access to abortion, Justice Breyer added, must make a cost-benefit calculation, weighing the burdens a law imposes on abortion access against the benefits it confers.Arkansas officials wrote that their state‚s law was not as onerous as the one from Texas, which required abortion providers to have admitting privileges. ‚Arkansas law only requires medication abortion providers to have a contractual relationship (to ensure follow-up treatment if needed) with a physician that has admitting privileges,‚ the officials‚ brief said.But Planned Parenthood said the Arkansas law would effectively require women to travel long distances to obtain even the abortion procedure that remained available. Women in Fayetteville, for instance, would have to make a 380-mile round-trip journey, twice, as Arkansas law also requires an in-person counseling session 48 hours before an abortion, the group said.‚Inability to travel to the sole remaining clinic in the state will lead some women to take desperate measures, such as attempting to self-abort or seeking care from unsafe providers,‚ Judge Baker wrote.Medication abortions are considered quite safe. One study found that six of every 10,000 women who used the procedure experienced complications requiring hospitalization.Since women typically take the second drug in the two-pill regimen at home, which may not be near the clinic, it is not clear that having a doctor on contract would make them safer than simply visiting an emergency room, Judge Baker wrote.‚Emergency room physicians are well qualified to evaluate and treat most complications that can arise after a medication abortion,‚ she wrote, adding that the relevant medical issues are ‚identical to those suffered by women experiencing miscarriage, who receive treatments in hospitals every day through emergency physicians.‚",Supreme Court Allows Arkansas Abortion Restrictions to Stand,"May 29, 2018 /  1:43 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-abortion/supreme-court-rejects-challenge-to-strict-arkansas-abortion-law-idUSKCN1IU1PH,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a setback to abortion rights advocates, the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday paved the way for Republican-backed restrictions on medication-induced abortions to take effect in Arkansas that could lead to the shuttering of two of the state’s three abortion clinics. The nine justices, with no noted dissents, declined to hear an appeal by abortion provider Planned Parenthood of a lower court ruling that had revived the 2015 state law, which sets regulations regarding the RU-486 “abortion pill,” after it was earlier struck down by a federal judge. The law had remained blocked pending the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court. Unless Planned Parenthood obtains a new injunction from a federal judge blocking the law - the group said it will seek such an order immediately - the state can enforce the statute, one of the most restrictive abortion measures in the United States.  Planned Parenthood, which contends that the law would ban medication abortion in Arkansas, also said it is telling patients they can no longer access medication abortions at its two clinics in the state. The only other abortion clinic in Arkansas, Little Rock Family Planning Services in the state capital, offers both surgical and medication abortions.  “This law cannot and must not stand. We will not stop fighting for every person’s right to access safe, legal abortion,” said Dawn Laguens, Planned Parenthood’s executive vice president. The Supreme Court in 1973 legalized abortion nationwide, but many Republican-governed states have passed laws seeking to impose a variety of restrictions, some so demanding that they may shut down abortion clinics and make the procedure far more difficult to obtain. “As Attorney General, I have fully defended this law at every turn and applaud the Supreme Court’s decision against Planned Parenthood today. Protecting the health and well-being of women and the unborn will always be a priority,” Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a Republican, said in a statement.  TEXAS RULING The justices, in a 2016 ruling, struck down a restrictive Republican-backed Texas law that had targeted abortion clinics and doctors in a decision that was seen as reaffirming and fortifying legal protections for abortion rights. Planned Parenthood had claimed the appeals court ruling in the Arkansas case had disregarded the precedent set in the Texas case. The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restored the law last year, reversing a 2016 ruling by a district court judge that had prevented it from going into effect. Planned Parenthood Great Plains sued the state in 2015, saying the law would deprive many Arkansas women of their legal right to an abortion.  The law involves the RU-486 “abortion pill,” also called mifepristone (brand name Mifeprex) and misoprostol (brand name Cytotec). It requires any doctor dispensing the drug to sign a contract with another doctor who would agree to handle any medical complications from it, an unusual and difficult-to-achieve arrangement. The contracted doctor also must have admitting privileges at a hospital designated to handle emergencies.  Arkansas said the law was aimed at protecting women against the “dangerous and potentially dangerous” off-label use of the abortion pills.  RU-486 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2000 subject to the instructions stated on the label. The “off-label” use prohibited by Arkansas allowed for less physician oversight when RU-486 is used. Planned Parenthood, which offers only medication-induced abortions at its two facilities in Arkansas, said the effect of the law would be to ban such abortions in the state. The district court judge had found that women in Fayetteville, for example, would have to make two 380-mile (610-km) round trips to get an abortion at what would be the state’s last remaining abortion clinic. Even as U.S. states pursue new abortion limits, restrictions in some other countries are loosening. Ireland voted overwhelmingly last week to repeal a constitutional amendment that banned abortion. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court left intact an Oklahoma court ruling that struck down a state law that would have effectively banned RU-486. In the Supreme Court’s current term, which runs through the end of June, the justices are weighing another abortion-related case. In that one, operators of Christian-affiliated “crisis pregnancy centers” that steer women with unplanned pregnancies away from abortion are challenging a California law that requires them to post notices telling women about the availability of state-subsidized abortions.

Judges considering laws restricting access to abortion, Justice Breyer added, must make a cost-benefit calculation, weighing the burdens a law imposes on abortion access against the benefits it confers.Arkansas officials wrote that their state‚s law was not as onerous as the one from Texas, which required abortion providers to have admitting privileges. ‚Arkansas law only requires medication abortion providers to have a contractual relationship (to ensure follow-up treatment if needed) with a physician that has admitting privileges,‚ the officials‚ brief said.But Planned Parenthood said the Arkansas law would effectively require women to travel long distances to obtain even the abortion procedure that remained available. Women in Fayetteville, for instance, would have to make a 380-mile round-trip journey, twice, as Arkansas law also requires an in-person counseling session 48 hours before an abortion, the group said.‚Inability to travel to the sole remaining clinic in the state will lead some women to take desperate measures, such as attempting to self-abort or seeking care from unsafe providers,‚ Judge Baker wrote.Medication abortions are considered quite safe. One study found that six of every 10,000 women who used the procedure experienced complications requiring hospitalization.Since women typically take the second drug in the two-pill regimen at home, which may not be near the clinic, it is not clear that having a doctor on contract would make them safer than simply visiting an emergency room, Judge Baker wrote.‚Emergency room physicians are well qualified to evaluate and treat most complications that can arise after a medication abortion,‚ she wrote, adding that the relevant medical issues are ‚identical to those suffered by women experiencing miscarriage, who receive treatments in hospitals every day through emergency physicians.‚",Supreme Court Allows Arkansas Abortion Restrictions to Stand,"May 29, 2018 /  1:36 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-abortion/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-challenge-to-arkansas-abortion-law-idUSW1N1QB00Y,"WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - In a setback to abortion rights advocates, the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday paved the way for Republican-backed restrictions on medication-induced abortions to take effect in Arkansas that could lead to the shuttering of two of the state’s three abortion clinics. The nine justices declined to hear an appeal by abortion provider Planned Parenthood of a lower court ruling that had revived the state law, which sets regulations regarding the RU-486 “abortion pill,” after it was earlier struck down by a federal judge. The law had remained blocked pending the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood could yet ask a judge to reimpose the injunction blocking the law.

10389588,1405,['2018-05-29t14:00:05.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/puerto-rico-deaths-hurricane.html,"As hurricane season begins this week, experts are still trying to count the number of deaths caused by last year‚s devastating Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. The latest estimate: roughly 4,600, many of them from delayed medical care.Residents of Puerto Rico died at a significantly higher rate during the three months after the hurricane than they did in the previous year, according to the results of a new study by a group of independent researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and other institutions.The researchers say their estimate, published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, remains imprecise, with more definitive studies still to come. But the findings, which used methods that have not been previously applied to this disaster, are important amid widespread concerns that the government‚s tally of the dead, 64, was a dramatic undercount.Winds, flooding and landslides swept away homes and knocked out power, water and cellular service, which remained largely unrepaired for months. An analysis of vital statistics by The New York Times last December found that 1,052 more people than usual died across the island in the 42 days after the storm. Other news organizations, including Puerto Rico‚s Center for Investigative Journalism, CNN, Buzzfeed and Alexis Ra√∫l Santos, a demographer at Penn State, have also challenged the government‚s figure, finding evidence for hundreds of excess deaths in the weeks after the hurricane.Researchers for this latest study visited more than 3,000 residences across the island and interviewed their occupants, who reported that 38 people living in their households had died between Sept. 20, when Hurricane Maria struck, and the end of 2017. That toll, converted into a mortality rate, was extrapolated to the larger population and compared with official statistics from the same period in 2016.Because the number of households surveyed was relatively small in comparison to the population‚s size, the true number of deaths beyond what was expected could range from about 800 to more than 8,000 people, the researchers‚ calculations show. The toll exceeded previous estimates, researchers said, in part because they looked at a longer time period.About 15 percent of the people interviewed reported that someone in their household was unable to get medicines for at least a day after the storm. Roughly 10 percent said that a household member had trouble using breathing equipment, which often relies on electricity. Fewer than 10 percent reported closed medical facilities and 6 percent said doctors were unavailable. The study estimates that about a third of the deaths were caused by a delay in medical care or the inability to obtain it.Under pressure, the government announced in December that all deaths that occurred after Maria hit would be reviewed and that people who died either directly or indirectly from the storm and its aftermath would be included in a revised tally. The government commissioned a review by researchers at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University, who had promised an initial report in May. But that analysis has barely begun. ‚They‚re still acquiring data,‚ said Dr. Lynn R. Goldman, the school‚s dean. The study will use the territory‚s vital records and information from funeral homes, the medical system and the larger public. Dr. Goldman now says she expects to deliver the initial review, which will cost $305,000, sometime this summer, with a more definitive analysis involving interviews with survivors and requiring additional funding following perhaps nine months later. She said she and her colleagues were delayed because they had failed to anticipate the need for the university to navigate different tax laws in preparing their contract with the government of Puerto Rico.The newly released study, by contrast, was conducted for about $50,000 without the participation of the territory‚s government, which the researchers said refused to provide data to them.On Tuesday, the government of Puerto Rico said it welcomed the new survey and looked forward to analyzing it. Carlos S. Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, said that both the Harvard survey and the George Washington University study will help Puerto Rico ‚better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost.‚ Results were produced quickly and at a modest cost by focusing on a randomized sample of the population, and by using mobile mapping technology and an army of graduate students to conduct the survey.‚It helped that a lot of them were psychology students, because they were going to be dealing with families in distress,‚ said Dr. Satchit Balsari, a research fellow at Harvard FXB Center for Health and Human Rights and one of the study‚s senior authors.The researchers found that many people had been displaced from their homes and had endured months without essential utilities, especially in remote areas. Those challenges affected the researchers, too, who downloaded digital map data before traveling to areas that still lacked cell service in early 2018. The surveyors used off-road vehicles because of the continuing threat of landslides in mountain areas. In part of Culebra, a small island off the main island of Puerto Rico, they arrived planning to interview 35 households. Only one person remained. ‚It was a bathroom and half a room,‚ said Domingo J. Marqu√©s, an associate professor of psychology at Albizu University San Juan, who helped conduct the study with his students and who himself lacked power and running water for months after the hurricane. ‚All the other houses were gone.‚Those conditions, he said, made clearer why the government‚s official death count was incomplete. ‚Even if they were really doing a good job, it was really hard unless you did something like we did ‚ go talk to people on the ground,‚ he said. People, he added, ‚died alone in their houses. Nobody went there. Some of them were covered by a landslide, and months after they‚ve not recovered the bodies.‚Notably, abnormally high death rates continued at least through the end of December. ‚They didn‚t show any sign of coming down in the several months following the hurricane that we were looking at,‚ said Caroline Buckee, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and the study‚s other senior author.‚There is clearly an excess mortality, and let‚s not argue very specific numbers,‚ said Dr. Gilbert Burnham, a professor of international health and founder of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the research, but has performed similar studies assessing deaths, including in Mosul, Iraq.Dr. Burnham said that despite the study‚s limitations, including the difficulty of estimating Puerto Rico‚s total population in light of migration, and the possible oversampling of smaller populations in more remote areas, such surveys ‚should become a standard activity in post-disaster situations,‚ because they help reveal vulnerabilities that can be addressed to save lives.Dr. Burnham and another expert unaffiliated with the study agreed with the researchers that the toll could be even higher than estimated if adjusted for the fact that people who died alone could not be surveyed. ‚It just is stunning how poor our information was as to what was happening in Puerto Rico,‚ said Leslie Roberts, a professor and director of the program on forced migration and health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.The use of surveys to assess the extent of deaths and suffering in disasters, and to guide improvements, extends back decades. Particularly important was a series of studies in Bangladesh in 1970 and 1971, which revealed that women died at a higher rate than men from a massive cyclone that the researchers estimated killed at least 224,000 people. In Puerto Rico, the researchers visited 104 barrios across the island, selecting them to ensure that both urban and nonurban areas were represented. In the areas most remote from cities, about one in five residences were abandoned. The researchers chose households at random in each of the barrios, asking about deaths in the home, deaths in the neighborhood, and access to electricity, running water and phone service.‚The situation is not over,‚ Dr. Marqu√©s said. ‚We still have people without power, without running water, and it‚s already hurricane season again.‚He added, ‚We hope our data helps the government develop some more specific continuity plans so they can prepare for proper general health and also mental health planning.‚","Puerto Rico‚Äôs Hurricane Maria Death Toll Could Exceed 4,000, New Study Estimates","May 29, 2018 /  6:40 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-casualties/study-hikes-puerto-ricos-hurricane-maria-death-toll-to-4645-idUSL2N1T0144,"May 29 (Reuters Health) - Hurricane Maria claimed the lives of 4,645 people in Puerto Rico last year and not the 64 long pegged by the island’s government as the official death toll, according to a survey of thousands of residents by a research team led by Harvard University. The researchers estimated that most victims of the storm died between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, 2017, as a direct or indirect result of Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in 90 years. One-third perished because of delayed or interrupted medical care. While cautioning that the estimate of 4,645 victims may be too low, the researchers said the numbers “underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico.” The tally, reported online on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, is likely to be controversial because it is far higher than previous independent estimates. The emergency response to the disaster became highly politicized and provoked criticism of President Donald Trump, who was faulted when much of the U.S. territory remained without power for months. Puerto Rico’s government released a statement on Tuesday welcoming the study and saying it would analyze it further. In the aftermath of the storm, Puerto Rico commissioned George Washington University to conduct an independent study into the death toll, the results of which are due soon. “As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities. We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported,” Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said in the government statement. The chief author of the new study, Caroline Buckee of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, did not respond to emails requesting comment. Maria, a major hurricane with winds close to 150 miles (241 km) per hour, caused an estimated $90 billion in damage to an island already struggling economically and many residents have subsequently left. There is a wide margin for error in the study authored by Buckee. While the researchers estimated 4,645 deaths, the actual number could be as low as 793 and as high as 8,498, the study showed. The tally of 4,645 dead is more than four times higher than a December estimate by the New York Times, which said the actual death toll was probably about 1,052. A Pennsylvania State University study put the number at 1,085. The Buckee team randomly conducted in-person surveys of 3,299 of the estimated 1.1 million Puerto Rican households earlier this year, making sure to include remote areas. Respondents were not paid and were asked if a household member had died directly or indirectly as a result of the storm. Missing people were not counted as deaths. Respondents were also asked about deaths within a five-minute walking distance of their homes. The Buckee team also said that in the aftermath of the storm households went, on average, 68 days without water, 84 days without electricity and 41 days without cell phone coverage. In the most remote areas, 83 percent of the households were still without power by Dec. 31.

Still, the latest one caught its 20 million residents off guard.It was all anyone here could talk about last week as people moved lethargically about their days, helpless to avoid temperatures that sometimes soared to above 110 degrees Fahrenheit, leaving people in a fever-like haze, even in the shade.The heat, radiating from roads and cement buildings well into the night, was made worse by the city‚s notorious lack of green space. Shops and households that can afford air-conditioners cranked them up, but most people were left with few options: wet washcloths and electric fans, and those only for the few hours when the power was on.The streets, normally congested with traffic, became eerily empty around noon. The traffic police listlessly motioned at cars from under umbrellas as people made their way indoors or hid for a few moments in the shadow of one of the city‚s many concrete towers ‚ anywhere that could provide some respite. The heat spiked on May 18, just days after the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ‚ during which all able-bodied Muslims are required to abstain from food and water from sunrise to sunset. The timing exacerbated the effects of the brutal temperatures. The death toll has reached 65, according to Faisal Edhi, the head of the Edhi Foundation, a charity that operates Karachi‚s biggest fleet of ambulances and its central morgue. Government officials dispute that figure.After four days, the extreme heat subsided ‚ to a relatively cooling average of 91 degrees Fahrenheit. But on Wednesday it‚s expected to be over 110 again.One of those who lost their lives was 30-year-old Tayyiba Feroz.When she went to cook food for her family on the evening of May 20, she was struggling with the heat but still felt fine, said her husband, Sheikh Mohammad Shiraz. She wasn‚t fasting because she was pregnant, and pregnant women are exempt from the religious obligation. The power goes out about six hours a day in their neighborhood, in one of the city‚s more crowded northern slums, so residents plan their days around the times it comes on. Her husband said she had insisted on cooking dinner that night, worried that she wouldn‚t be able to feed the family when the power would inevitably fail again.He said she had been laughing with their 3-year-old son before heading to the stove to prepare dinner. Minutes later, she collapsed and died.Mr. Shiraz, arranging traditional Quranic recitations a week later, seemed unable to process her sudden demise. He suspects that the heat from the stove compounded her dehydration.And he is racked with guilt because, he said, he knows well the signs of heat stroke from his job as an ambulance driver for the Edhi Foundation.Mr. Shiraz, holding his son in his lap, said that in the past three years he had seen at least two dozen people die of heat stroke, most of them in June 2015, when Karachi suffered through one of the deadliest heat waves in history. More than 1,000 people died in two weeks then, overwhelming hospitals and emergency responders.‚I saw men fall dead in the street,‚ he said. ‚We‚d have people die in the back of our ambulances. It was nonstop.‚ Mr. Edhi, whose family began the Edhi Foundation, said he believed the true number of casualties was underreported in 2015 and continues to be underreported.The 65 deaths his group reported this year, he said, are ‚just deaths that we know about in Karachi.‚‚Outside of the city, dozens more could have died,‚ Mr. Edhi said. ‚But we just don‚t have records.‚ Mr. Edhi said that during the heat wave, bodies began arriving at the morgue at over twice the usual rate, and that the local government should do more to help people handle the heat.The city has not released official numbers on fatalities, and its top official says no one died from heat stroke, but rather from heat-related injuries, like dehydration.Dr. Seemin Jamali, the executive director of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, one of the biggest hospitals in Karachi, said the city had learned from the experiences of 2015. ‚We‚re absolutely more in control of the situation,‚ she said. Heat waves have been more frequent in Karachi since that time, but the recent one is the worst since then.During Ramadan, Pakistan enforces a public ban on eating or drinking, with up to three months‚ prison time for those found guilty of violating the ban.Mufti Muhammad Naeem, the head of Karachi‚s biggest religious seminary, said Islamic jurisprudence was clear about fasting during hot summer months. ‚It‚s only acceptable to break your fast if you‚re near death,‚ he said. ‚But doctors are quick to encourage us to drink water at the slightest sign of hot weather these days.‚‚This is against Shariah,‚ he added.His beliefs are held widely among the city, leaving a gray area for strict believers who balance the risks of fatigue and heat stroke with religious requirements when the city‚s temperatures climb.Residents of Karachi‚s slums ‚ by some estimates 61 percent of the population lives in the haphazard concrete sprawl along the city‚s perimeter ‚ face other challenges in dealing with the heat.  The city‚s own water utility says 42 percent of its supply, which is meant to reach nearly 20 million people, is stolen or lost. The result is extreme water scarcity in an already arid climate, with steep prices and instability for the city‚s poorest residents.Mr. Shiraz said he was forced to buy water from a criminal syndicate even though his home was connected to a water line. ‚We never get water from our taps,‚ he said. The water is cut ‚at the source,‚ he added, ‚so we buy it from them.‚The police and city officials have  tried to close down the criminal groups. And the city has made progress in limiting power failures in recent years. Still, widespread blackouts returned to Karachi in April as a deadlock continues in a battle between the city‚s electricity supplier and gas company.The result is that the city‚s poorest are left to cope with punishing heat without stable water or electricity supplies. Mr. Edhi, leafing through his records of the deceased, said almost all of last week‚s dead had come from slums where most of the city‚s labor force resides.Mr. Shiraz is preparing to return to work as an ambulance driver after the customary 10-day grieving period. ‚I‚m keeping fast, of course,‚ he said. ‚I‚ll pay my respects at my wife‚s grave in the morning and get back to the dispatch center.‚",Looking for a Bit of Shade as Intense Heat Wave Hits Karachi,"May 21, 2018 /  8:52 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-heatwave/pakistan-heatwave-kills-65-people-in-karachi-welfare-organization-idUSKCN1IM2AU,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A heatwave has killed 65 people in Pakistan’s southern city of Karachi over the past three days, a social welfare organization said on Tuesday, amid fears the death toll could climb as the high temperatures persist. The heatwave has coincided with power outages and the holy month of Ramadan, when most Muslims do not eat or drink during daylight hours. Temperatures hit 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) on Monday, local media reported. Faisal Edhi, who runs the Edhi Foundation that operates morgues and an ambulance service in Pakistan’s biggest city, said the deaths occurred mostly in the poor areas of Karachi. “Sixty-five people have died over the last three days,” Edhi told Reuters. “We have the bodies in our cold storage facilities and their neighborhood doctors have said they died of heat-stroke.” A government spokesperson could not be reached for comment. But Sindh province’s Health Secretary Fazlullah Pechuho told the English-language Dawn newspaper that no one has died from heat-stroke. “Only doctors and hospitals can decide whether the cause of death was heat-stroke or not. I categorically reject that people have died due to heat-stroke in Karachi,” Pechuho was quoted as saying. Residents cool off from the heatwave, as they are sprayed with water jetting out from a leaking water pipeline in Karachi, Pakistan May 22, 2018. REUTERS/Akhtar SoomroNonetheless, reports of heat stroke deaths in Karachi will stir unease amid fears of a repeat of a heatwave in of 2015, when morgues and hospitals were overwhelmed and at least 1,300 mostly elderly and sick people died from the searing heat. In 2015, the Edhi morgue ran out of freezer space after about 650 bodies were brought in the space of a few days. Ambulances left decaying corpses outside in sweltering heat. The provincial government has assured residents that there would be no repeat of 2015 and was working on ensuring those in need of care receive rapid treatment. Edhi said most of the dead brought to the morgue were working class factory workers who came from the low-income Landhi and Korangi areas of Karachi. “They work around heaters and boilers in textile factories and there is eight to nine hours of (scheduled power outages) in these areas,” he said.

Similar objections drove efforts to block the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to the United States.Environmentalists and some indigenous groups have strongly opposed the expansion of the pipeline, citing environmental concerns. The province of British Columbia is trying to block it in the courts. But the oil industry and the Alberta government argue that the expansion would bring needed jobs and help the economy.The purchase of the pipeline, for 4.5 billion Canadian dollars, puts the government squarely on the side of the oil industry. ‚The Trans Mountain expansion project is of vital interest to Canada and Canadians,‚ Bill Morneau, the federal finance minister, told reporters after a special cabinet meeting in Ottawa to discuss the deal. ‚Our government‚s position is clear: It must be built, and it will be built.‚Since taking office in 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has introduced several measures to mitigate climate change, including introducing a nationwide carbon pricing plan. But he also contends that Canada‚s economic well-being depends on its having a vibrant energy industry. The decision to buy the pipeline from its American owner, Kinder Morgan, may become the biggest test of Mr. Trudeau‚s assertion that his government is balancing the needs of the energy industry with environmental concerns like climate change. It is likely to sour Mr. Trudeau‚s relations with environmental groups.Aurore Fauret, a campaign coordinator for the environmental group 350.org, said Mr. Trudeau ‚has moved from being a climate leader to a pipeline cheerleader.‚ She vowed that protests would continue.Over the past few years the pipeline has prompted large protests in British Columbia, and dozens of people have been arrested for breaking a court order limiting demonstrations near Kinder Morgan‚s tanker terminal in Burnaby, British Columbia.The efforts echo the protracted and large protests against Keystone XL, a pipeline also linking the Alberta oil sands to the United States, at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota.John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia, said the province would not back down from its court action challenging the federal government‚s exclusive jurisdiction. ‚Today‚s announcement by the federal government does not reduce the risk of a diluted bitumen spill,‚ Mr. Horgan said at a news conference, using the technical name for the petroleum from oil sands. ‚I will continue to do my best to protect B.C.‚s interests.‚ The expansion will put a second pipeline alongside about 610 miles of the 715-mile Trans Mountain pipeline, which opened in 1953. It will increase the system‚s capacity to 890,000 barrels a day, from 300,000, at a cost of $7.4 billion.Most of the oil sent through the Trans Mountain pipeline heads to the United States either through a spur pipeline or aboard tankers. Supporters of the expansion argue that it will open Asia as a second market for Canadian oil.The Trans Mountain plan could be the energy industry‚s last stand in Canada. A previous plan to link the oil sands with the coast of British Columbia was abandoned, as was a proposed pipeline to eastern Canada.The pipeline plan has also started an unusually acrimonious war of words, litigation and legislation between British Columbia and Alberta, which relies on the energy industry for high-paying jobs and billions of dollars in resource royalty payments.Mr. Horgan‚s opposition to the pipeline appears rooted, at least partly, in political calculations in British Columbia. His government needs the support of three lawmakers from British Columbia‚s Green Party to stay in power. They all adamantly oppose the pipeline.British Columbia‚s opposition led Kinder Morgan to suspend nonessential spending on Trans Mountain last month. The company also said it would give up on the expansion if British Columbia did not stop its efforts to halt the plan by this Thursday. Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, has fired back at Mr. Horgan. She briefly stopped wine imports from British Columbia and this month signed a law allowing her government to suspend oil and gas supplies to its neighbor, a move British Columbia is also contesting in court. On Tuesday, Ms. Notley appeared to take credit for the action by Mr. Trudeau‚s government.‚We said we would get the pipeline built and we are getting it built,‚ she said in Edmonton, wearing a button supporting the project and surrounded by members of her caucus. ‚This deal and this pipeline will unlock investment in our oil sands.‚Mr. Morneau, the federal finance minister, said the government would eventually sell the pipeline, in its expanded form, back to the private sector. The government has suggested that it might even turn a profit.Polls indicate that Canadians over all are split about the pipeline and the expansion plan.Mr. Trudeau‚s Liberals currently enjoy considerable support in the Vancouver area, but his party has long been unpopular in Alberta ‚ a bastion of conservative politics in Canada, Ms. Notley‚s left-of-center government notwithstanding.Keith D. Brownsey, a professor of political science at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, said he expected the Liberals might lose seats in British Columbia in next year‚s election because of the Trans Mountain deal.But he said the decision to buy the pipeline will benefit the party on the whole, particularly when combined with its climate remediation steps and its strengthening of environmental oversight of proposed energy projects.‚Mr. Trudeau has probably saved his political career,‚ Mr. Brownsey said. ‚You may or may not agree with getting more oil to market. But what good is the federal government if they can‚t expand an existing pipeline along an existing right of way? He can now say the federal government has done something.‚",Canadian Government to Buy Kinder Morgan‚Äôs Trans Mountain Pipeline,"May 30, 2018 /  7:28 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline/canadas-purchase-of-trans-mountain-was-exceptional-minister-idUSL2N1T11QB,"CALGARY, Alberta, May 30 (Reuters) - Canada’s decision to buy Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s Trans Mountain pipeline was brought about by a “particularly problematic” situation and is not a symbol of how things get done in the country, the finance minister said on Wednesday. Canada on Tuesday agreed to buy the pipeline for C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion) in an effort to save a project that faces formidable political and environmental opposition on worries about the pipeline spilling its tar-like heavy oil. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the decision was exceptional and that the rule of law needs to be seen as a business advantage to investing in Canada. “We don’t see this as a symbol of the way to get things done in this country,” Morneau told an audience in Calgary, home to Canada’s energy industry. The planned expansion of Trans Mountain would nearly triple the capacity, running from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific province of British Columbia, which is opposed to the project. But the federal government has repeatedly said the project is in the national interest. But opposition efforts by British Columbia threaten to further delay the project, which was approved by the federal government in 2016. Morneau also reiterated that the government will seek private ownership of the project when it makes sense. ($1 = 1.2880 Canadian dollars) Reporting by Rod Nickel in Calgary

It will increase the system‚s capacity to 890,000 barrels a day, from 300,000, at a cost of $7.4 billion.Most of the oil sent through the Trans Mountain pipeline heads to the United States either through a spur pipeline or aboard tankers. Supporters of the expansion argue that it will open Asia as a second market for Canadian oil.The Trans Mountain plan could be the energy industry‚s last stand in Canada. A previous plan to link the oil sands with the coast of British Columbia was abandoned, as was a proposed pipeline to eastern Canada.The pipeline plan has also started an unusually acrimonious war of words, litigation and legislation between British Columbia and Alberta, which relies on the energy industry for high-paying jobs and billions of dollars in resource royalty payments.Mr. Horgan‚s opposition to the pipeline appears rooted, at least partly, in political calculations in British Columbia. His government needs the support of three lawmakers from British Columbia‚s Green Party to stay in power. They all adamantly oppose the pipeline.British Columbia‚s opposition led Kinder Morgan to suspend nonessential spending on Trans Mountain last month. The company also said it would give up on the expansion if British Columbia did not stop its efforts to halt the plan by this Thursday. Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, has fired back at Mr. Horgan. She briefly stopped wine imports from British Columbia and this month signed a law allowing her government to suspend oil and gas supplies to its neighbor, a move British Columbia is also contesting in court. On Tuesday, Ms. Notley appeared to take credit for the action by Mr. Trudeau‚s government.‚We said we would get the pipeline built and we are getting it built,‚ she said in Edmonton, wearing a button supporting the project and surrounded by members of her caucus. ‚This deal and this pipeline will unlock investment in our oil sands.‚Mr. Morneau, the federal finance minister, said the government would eventually sell the pipeline, in its expanded form, back to the private sector. The government has suggested that it might even turn a profit.Polls indicate that Canadians over all are split about the pipeline and the expansion plan.Mr. Trudeau‚s Liberals currently enjoy considerable support in the Vancouver area, but his party has long been unpopular in Alberta ‚ a bastion of conservative politics in Canada, Ms. Notley‚s left-of-center government notwithstanding.Keith D. Brownsey, a professor of political science at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, said he expected the Liberals might lose seats in British Columbia in next year‚s election because of the Trans Mountain deal.But he said the decision to buy the pipeline will benefit the party on the whole, particularly when combined with its climate remediation steps and its strengthening of environmental oversight of proposed energy projects.‚Mr. Trudeau has probably saved his political career,‚ Mr. Brownsey said. ‚You may or may not agree with getting more oil to market. But what good is the federal government if they can‚t expand an existing pipeline along an existing right of way? He can now say the federal government has done something.‚",Canadian Government to Buy Kinder Morgan‚Äôs Trans Mountain Pipeline,"May 30, 2018 /  7:37 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline/canada-finance-minister-defends-trans-mountain-purchase-idUSKCN1IV2M6,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s decision to buy Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s Trans Mountain pipeline was brought about by a “particularly problematic” situation and is not a symbol of how things get done in the country, the finance minister said on Wednesday. Canada's Finance Minister Bill Morneau takes part in a news conference about the state of the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, May 29, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Wattie Canada on Tuesday agreed to buy the pipeline for C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion) in an effort to save a project that faces formidable opposition from environmentalists and British Columbia officials worried the pipeline could spill its tar-like heavy oil. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the decision was exceptional and that the rule of law needs to be seen as a business advantage to investing in Canada. “We don’t see this as a symbol of the way to get things done in this country,” Morneau told a business audience in Calgary, home to Canada’s energy industry. He was briefly interrupted by several anti-pipeline protesters. But Perrin Beatty, chief executive of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said the government needs to revamp the “badly broken” regulatory system for major energy projects. He said the Liberal government’s planned reforms are not sufficient to preclude the repeat of another situation like Trans Mountain. “We have to have a system where it’s possible to get an answer and where it’s possible to act on that answer,” Beatty said. “What we’ve been getting in Canada is decision by delay.” Morneau said that while the government will listen to bidders for the pipeline in the short-term, its sale will depend on being certain that it will get built. Ottawa has said it does not intend to own the project in the long-term. Morneau reiterated that multiple potential investors have approached the government. He gave no specifics, though he said pension funds and aboriginal groups have approached him personally.  The planned expansion of Trans Mountain would nearly triple the capacity, running from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific province of British Columbia, which is opposed to the project. The federal government has repeatedly said the project is in the national interest. But opposition in British Columbia threaten to further delay the project, which was approved by the federal government in 2016. British Columbia’s Premier John Horgan told broadcaster Global News on Wednesday that he “rejected” the idea that his relationship with the federal government has deteriorated over the dispute. “We disagree on one issue,” Horgan said.

Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, initially feared that they would be inundated with civilian casualties from a lethal, Soviet-developed nerve agent and that their colleagues had been exposed, they have told the BBC.The accounts suggest that the British authorities were deeply apprehensive about the possibility of a larger health crisis in the hours after the Skripals were found unconscious on March 4, in what was initially believed to be an opioid overdose.That evening, after hearing that Mr. Skripal had been a Russian spy, medical workers set aside that theory and began to catalog symptoms of poisoning by an organophosphate, or nerve agent.‚There was a real concern as to how big this could get,‚ Lorna Wilkinson, the nursing director at Salisbury District Hospital, said in an interview with the BBC Two program ‚Newsnight‚ that will be broadcast on Tuesday. ‚Have we just gone from having two index patients having something that could become all-consuming and involve many casualties? Because we really didn‚t know at that point.‚ Dr. Stephen Jukes, a physician in the intensive care unit there, said that hospital workers had believed the Skripals would die.‚We were expecting them not to survive,‚ he said. ‚We would try all our therapies. We would ensure the best clinical care. But all the evidence was there that they would not survive.‚He told the BBC that the speed of the Skripals‚ recovery was a surprise, and that he still found it difficult to explain. Both patients have been released from the hospital.The interviews help flesh out the background of the Skripal case, which provoked a major diplomatic crisis between Britain and Russia. Within days, the British authorities accused Russia of using a military-grade nerve agent to poison the Skripals, but investigators have been tight-lipped for weeks about their progress, and no suspects have been named.In the resulting vacuum, the Russian authorities have challenged Britain‚s account with a raft of theories, among them that British intelligence poisoned the Skripals and that they were not poisoned at all. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has scoffed publicly at the British accusations, saying that if the Skripals had been exposed to a Russian nerve agent they would have died immediately. A video statement by Ms. Skripal, released last week, seemed intended to defuse that challenge. In their BBC interviews, the medical workers said that they had taken immediate measures to protect the Skripals from brain damage, sedating them heavily to slow their metabolism. Over time, the sedation was decreased, and respiratory tubes were switched from the mouth to the trachea.Once the patients regained consciousness, hospital workers tried to avoid telling them too much about what had happened, for fear of compromising the investigation, said the hospital‚s medical director, Dr. Christine Blanshard. They also had to decide when the Skripals were healthy enough to be questioned by detectives.‚These are very difficult decisions,‚ Dr. Blanshard said. ‚On one hand, you want to provide reassurance to the patients that they are safe and they are being looked after, and on the other hand, you don‚t want to give them information that might cause difficulties with subsequent police interviews.‚Doctors would have been able to apply lifesaving therapies as soon as it was clear that the Skripals had been exposed to a nerve agent, since the treatment is the same as for sarin or VX, according to a commentary published this month in the scientific journal Clinical Toxicology. The paper, titled ‚Novichok: A Murderous Nerve Agent Attack in the U.K.,‚ was written by J. Allister Vale, a professor of toxicology at the University of Birmingham, with Timothy C. Marrs and Robert L. Manyard.Nerve agents, which inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, can cause fatal respiratory paralysis within minutes if the exposure is severe, the paper said. It added, however, that ‚mild or moderately exposed individuals usually recover completely.‚ Symptoms can include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors and convulsions.The most important therapies are atropine, oximes and anticonvulsants. Atropine prevents the nose and lungs from producing too much fluid. Oximes reactivate acetylcholinesterase. Benzodiazepines are anticonvulsants and can reduce anxiety.The paper says Detective Sgt. Nick Bailey, who was exposed to the nerve agent while ‚helping the Skripals,‚ was initially discharged from the hospital emergency room, but was readmitted after his condition deteriorated. He remained under treatment for two and a half weeks.",Skripal Attack Scared U.K. Doctors: ‚ÄòWe Were Expecting Them Not to Survive‚Äô,"May 28, 2018 /  11:06 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-russia-skripal-salisbury/doctors-who-treated-skripals-uncertain-about-their-long-term-health-idUSL5N1SZ3I4,"LONDON (Reuters) - The doctors who treated a Russian former spy and his daughter after they were poisoned with a nerve agent in Britain say they don’t know what the pair’s long term health outlook is - and initially feared the incident could have been much worse. Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russia’s military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain, and daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4. Staff at Salisbury hospital, where they were treated, told the BBC that some started to wonder whether they too would fall victim to the nerve agent. Asked about the long term impact of the poisoning on the Skripals health, the hospital’s medical director, Christine Blanshard, said the prognosis was uncertain. “The honest answer is we don’t know,” she said, according to extracts of an interview released by the BBC’s Newsnight program. Britain has said that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the poisoning of the Skripals, and western governments, including the United States, have expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning and retaliated in kind.     Yulia Skripal spoke to Reuters last week, saying her recovery had been “slow and extremely painful” and that she was lucky to have survived. Hospital staff too said that they expected the Skripals would die as a result of the poisoning. “All the evidence was there that they would not survive,” said Stephen Jukes, an intensive care consultant who treated the Skripals a week after they arrived at the hospital. He added that the medical team initially suspected the Skripals were suffering an opioid overdose before the diagnosis quickly changed. The cathedral city of Salisbury was transformed by the incident, with major shopping areas cordoned off while decontamination of locations the Skripals visited took place. A policeman was admitted to hospital with symptoms after attending to the Skripals, and hospital staff feared that the incident might have been far more serious than first thought. “When the (policeman) was admitted with symptoms - there was a real concern as to how big could this get,” Lorna Wilkinson, director of nursing at the hospital, said, adding she feared it could have “become all-consuming and involve many casualties”  “We really didn’t know at that point.” FILE PHOTO: Ambulances and a police car are parked outside the emergency room at Salisbury District Hospital, Britain, March 6, 2018.

By 10 p.m. on Tuesday, Israel said there had been 70 rockets or mortars fired from Gaza throughout the day.The military wing of Hamas ‚ the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza ‚ claimed responsibility jointly with another faction, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Earlier in the day, it was initially assumed that Islamic Jihad was behind most of the attacks after Israel killed three of its members on Sunday.‚Bombing will be met by bombing and blood for blood,‚ the two groups said in the joint claim.Israel responded with airstrikes on 35 targets in Gaza after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel held Hamas responsible for the mortar attacks. Israel‚s Iron Dome antimissile system intercepted dozens of incoming projectiles, according to the military. Three soldiers and one civilian were injured on the Israeli side, but no fatalities were reported.Tensions have been spiraling along the border in recent weeks during a series of Palestinian protests against the 11-year blockade of the Gaza Strip and to press Palestinian claims to lands in what is now Israel. Israel insisted that it was not seeking to escalate, and that it was up to Hamas to decide whether to ratchet things up or stand down.‚Quiet will be met with quiet and violence with an appropriate response,‚ said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman. But as he spoke, Israel‚s civil defense system was alerting its citizens to a fresh round of incoming rockets and more alerts followed.Late Tuesday, after a deluge of Israeli civil defense alerts about incoming fire from Gaza, Palestinian Islamic Jihad announced a cease-fire and credited Egyptian mediation for the deal. But Israel did not confirm such an agreement, and well after midnight the alerts of launchings from Gaza continued unabated.Early Wednesday, Israel announced a new wave of airstrikes against 25 more Hamas targets in Gaza, saying it was holding Hamas responsible for conducting and allowing a ‚wide-scale attack against Israeli citizens.‚ The United States called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the latest attacks on Israel from Gaza and said it expected the session to be held on Wednesday afternoon. ‚The recent attacks out of Gaza are the largest we have seen since 2014,‚ said the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley. ‚Mortars fired by Palestinian militants hit civilian infrastructure, including a kindergarten. The Security Council should be outraged and respond to this latest bout of violence directed at innocent Israeli civilians, and the Palestinian leadership needs to be held accountable for what they‚re allowing to happen in Gaza.‚The Israeli military also said it had discovered and destroyed a U-shaped tunnel dug by Hamas from Gaza heading south into Egypt, then looping back north and extending about 900 yards into Israel. Colonel Conricus said the tunnel was intended for both smuggling and attacks and had been completed but not yet been put into use.One mortar shell fired Tuesday morning struck in the yard of a kindergarten in an Israeli border community shortly before preschoolers were to arrive. Television images showed the fortified walls of the kindergarten pockmarked with shrapnel and hunks of metal from the mortar shell jutting out of the sand in the playground.Soon after the initial barrage of 25 mortars, Israeli authorities announced a return to normal and schools and kindergartens in the area opened as usual, suggesting that the military was not expecting, or planning, an immediate escalation into a broader conflict.Half an hour later, however, sirens blared again as more mortar rounds were launched. That was followed by more sirens and more mortars.By afternoon, cellphones were buzzing with alerts of incoming rockets a few times an hour, and Colonel Conricus said local residents had been told not to stray more than a 15-second run from the nearest bomb shelter. ‚In some cases over the last few hours, we‚ve been able to provide 20 seconds of warning. But the current standard of warning is for 15 seconds,‚ he said. One of the rockets fired from Gaza hit a major supply line for electricity from Israel to Gaza and Israel‚s electric company said repairs would have to wait until it was safe for crews to work on it. That was expected to further reduce the sporadic electricity supply that already leaves Gazans without power for many hours a day.Suspicion for Tuesday‚s attacks initially fell on Islamic Jihad, an extremist group backed by Iran which sometimes rivals Hamas but sometimes works with the group against Israel.On Sunday, Israel shelled an Islamic Jihad observation post in southern Gaza, killing three members of the group.The Israeli military said it was a response to an explosive being planted the night before along the security fence dividing Gaza from Israel. The bomb, hidden in a pair of wire cutters, exploded as sappers neutralized it remotely. There were no injuries on the Israeli side.Islamic Jihad vowed to respond. Dawoud Shehab, a spokesman for the group, welcomed the mortar barrage, saying, ‚Our Palestinian people‚s blood is not cheap.‚ Both Islamic Jihad and Hamas are heavily funded by Iran, the Israeli military noted, adding that the mortars used Tuesday were standard Iranian munitions. But officials stopped short of accusing Iran of ordering the attack.Experts said that there was ample room for the two sides to return to a standoff after Tuesday‚s fighting, but that a different outcome of the morning‚s mortar attack could have tied Israel‚s hands.Amos Harel, the military affairs analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said if the mortar had struck near the kindergarten half an hour later, it would likely have led to a major Israeli campaign. ‚If we had, God forbid, two or three kids dying there, then the public reaction and political reaction would have been much different and we may have been facing a larger Israeli operation, even a ground operation in Gaza right now,‚ he said.Mr. Netanyahu met late Tuesday with the defense minister and the army chief of staff.‚Israel views harshly the attacks against it and its communities by Hamas and Islamic Jihad from Gaza,‚ the prime minister said earlier in the day. ‚Israel will exact a heavy price from whoever tries to harm it and we view Hamas as bearing the responsibility for preventing such attacks against us.‚The United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay E. Mladenov, condemned the barrage of fire out of Gaza. ‚Such attacks are unacceptable and undermine the serious efforts by the international community to improve the situation in Gaza,‚ he said. ‚All parties must exercise restraint, avoid escalation and prevent incidents that jeopardize the lives of Palestinians and Israelis.‚As many as 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since March 30, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, mostly by snipers during the protests and half of them in a single day, May 14, the peak of the campaign.The May 14 protests were timed to coincide with the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem and came on the eve of the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call the nakba, or catastrophe, referring to the war surrounding Israel‚s establishment in 1948.Israel said it was defending its border and the nearby communities against a mass breach by the protesters, adding that Gaza militants intended to use unarmed civilian protesters as cover to infiltrate Israeli territory and attack Israeli soldiers and civilians.Palestinians have also sent incendiary kites and balloons over the border fence from Gaza, setting hundreds of fires in the fields and forest on the Israeli side.Over the weekend, a small group of Palestinians cut through the fence and set fire to an empty Israeli military post. Israeli fighter jets struck a Hamas military compound in response. And late Monday, heavy machine-gun fire from Gaza hit buildings in the Israeli border town of Sderot.Tuesday‚s hostilities extended not just below and above ground, but out to sea. A Hamas boat carrying people needing medical attention attempted to run the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza and head to Cyprus. But it was stopped and the boat was towed to the Israeli port city of Ashdod without any harm to the 17 people aboard, Israel said.",Gaza Militants Barrage Israel With Mortars and Rockets,"May 27, 2018 /  8:28 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-violence/israeli-army-kills-three-gaza-militants-after-foiling-border-bombing-idUSKCN1IS06K,"GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli tank shelling killed three members of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, medical officials said, after weeks of border protests that have drawn lethal army fire.

Video issued on the military’s Twitter feed showed the bomb being detonated safely.   Islamic Jihad operates with a measure of independence from Hamas, the Islamist group that has controlled Gaza since 2007 and fought three wars against Israel.  Hostilities over the frontier have soared since Palestinians began mass-demonstrations on March 30, which Israel deems to be cover for attempts to breach the border fence. At least 115 Palestinians have been killed and thousands hurt by army gunfire in the protests, drawing foreign censure.

REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu MustafaOrganizers said they would ramp up demonstrations on Tuesday with a flotilla of boats that would set off from Gaza in an attempt to break Israel’s maritime blockade of the enclave.  “Gaza has become a big, isolated prison, deprived of minimal rights, because of the unjust Israeli siege,” they said in a statement, referring to clampdowns by Israel and neighbor Egypt. Israel has blunted the military capabilities of Hamas with a series of counter-measures: the Iron Dome air defense system against short-range rockets and a system for detecting and destroying cross-border guerrilla tunnels.  Slideshow (5 Images)In the latest move, Israel’s Defence Ministry said on Sunday that work had started on a maritime wall that would block infiltration by seaborne Palestinian fighters from north Gaza.  The sea wall, due to be complete by the end of the year, entails three layers below and above the Mediterranean surface, and will employ fortified rock as well as barbed wire, the ministry said.  There have been no Israeli casualties along the Gaza frontier, but Israel has reported extensive damage to farmland on its side of the border from firebomb-bearing kites flown over by Palestinians. To counter that threat, the Israeli military said it has mobilized private drone-racers as army reservists, who then try to ram into the kites with the remote-controlled aircraft. “We’ll deal with the kites, too,” security cabinet minister Naftali Bennett told Israel Radio, when asked about the military’s actions around Gaza. In Israel, the military announced the death on Saturday of a soldier who was injured during a raid in the occupied West Bank on Thursday when Palestinians dropped a stone slab on his head from a building.

13350356,1690,['2018-05-31t03:45:04.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/business/energy-environment/hamburg-germany-diesel.html,"Local and national authorities across Europe are considering, and in some cases already placing, restrictions on diesel vehicles in city centers ‚ with one notable exception: Germany. Now, that is changing.On Thursday, Hamburg became the first city in Germany to put in place any kind of ban on diesel vehicles, after a federal court ruled in February that it was legal for local authorities to prohibit older diesel engines. But the limited nature of the restriction, affecting only a couple of the city‚s main thoroughfares, drew criticism from locals and environmental campaigners.It is a sign that, even though the diesel engine was a German invention, opposition to the fuel is growing in the country. Concerns have mounted over the use of diesel in the wake of a Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal and increasing evidence of its harmful health and environmental impacts. In contrast to their neighbors in Europe, though, German authorities had thus far been reluctant to restrict diesel vehicles, after decades of lobbying by the country‚s powerful automakers.‚We believe this will trigger a domino effect in Germany,‚ said Ugo Taddei, a lawyer at ClientEarth, one of two environmental nonprofits that took the diesel ban lawsuit to the federal court in Germany. ‚Many cities are facing very serious air pollution problems, and they will need to set restrictions.‚ Hamburg, a port city in northern Germany, was forced to outline how it would improve its air quality after being sued by a resident and an environmental group.So starting Thursday, all diesel vehicles without the latest so-called Euro 6 technology will be prohibited from driving through a stretch along Max-Brauer-Allee in the Altona area in the center of town, and trucks without the newest technology will not be allowed on a portion of a nearby highway known as Stresemannstrasse. The two streets were chosen because emissions from traffic tended to accumulate there, as a result of relatively little open space and wind passing through.In the early weeks of the ban, the police are planning to hand out warnings to offending motorists, a police spokesman said on Thursday. Eventually, though, they will actively check vehicles by inspecting individual registration papers and hand out fines of 20 euros, or $23, to car drivers and ‚Ç¨75 to truck drivers found to be in contravention of the rules.The ban, though limited in scope, has been seen as an important first step to making similar restrictions more widespread across Germany, where the presence of a huge auto industry has made moves toward such measures more difficult. If the move is shown to improve air quality, other cities could use it as evidence to support their own policies.‚Cities will look at this kind of thing and say, ‚Yes, we‚ve got data to show it works,‚‚ said Peter Wells, a professor at Cardiff Business School in Wales who focuses on the auto industry. ‚If it‚s replicated and it‚s expanded, it becomes a huge issue.‚ The limited geographic application of the Hamburg ban, however, has attracted criticism that the city is just spreading pollution to other areas to improve readings along the two main artery roads.‚It won‚t amount to much,‚ complained Rashid Shater, the owner of Cyclefactory, a high-end bicycle shop on Max-Brauer-Allee.Jan Dube, a spokesman for Hamburg‚s Department for the Environment and Energy, said the diversions were not expected to raise emissions elsewhere in the city above European Union limits. He added that the city was also working on expanding its bus and bicycle lane network as part of broader efforts to improve air quality.The VDA, which represents the auto industry in Germany, has been pushing for alternative remedies like park-and-ride services. The group said in a statement that driving bans were not the most effective way to combat poor air quality.‚The natural renewal of modern and clean diesel vehicles on its own will lead to a significant increase in air quality in the coming years,‚ it said.About a third of passenger vehicles in the country run on diesel, and carmakers have spent decades promoting the technology. But thanks to a series of scandals, sales of diesel vehicles have been falling ‚ the proportion of Germany‚s cars that run on the fuel dropped this year compared with 2017, the first such annual decline in decades, according to the German transport authority.It is part of a wider shift away from diesel, and the internal combustion engine, across Europe. Along with moves by cities to ban or restrict diesel vehicles, countries like Britain, France and Norway plan to do away with gas or diesel engines entirely. The restrictions in Hamburg are only the latest challenge facing Germany‚s automotive sector. Along with the looming threat of tariffs from the United States, new technology like electric and autonomous vehicles raises the prospect of a radically reshaped auto industry worldwide.Still, at least one Hamburg institution is looking forward to an improvement in air quality ‚ the Allee Theater, a venue that hosts a chamber opera and a children‚s theater and that lies along Max-Brauer-Allee.‚We are looking forward to opening the windows,‚ said Friederike Barthel, a spokeswoman.","In a First for Germany, Hamburg Bans Diesel Engines.

A worker picks up a traffic sign which bans diesel cars in downtown Hamburg, Germany May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian BimmerHamburg’s environmental authorities said on Wednesday they had put up around 100 signs this week announcing the ban in two streets and offering directions for alternative routes. German cities are under pressure to meet legal clean air targets to reduce illness caused by emissions. European car companies have invested heavily in diesel, which produces less of the carbon that causes global warming than gasoline engines, but more of other pollutants blamed for health problems. The prospect that cities could ban dirtier diesel vehicles has wide implications for the future of Europe’s car industry.   Hamburg is still waiting to find out from the court whether it will be allowed to apply the ban to all cars with engines that fail to meet the 2014 “Euro 6” standard, or only to the far smaller number that fail to meet the 2009 “Euro 5” standard. “We expect to put the driving ban into effect in May. Therefore, it’s necessary to receive a written statement of the ruling from the administrative court in Leipzig,” said Bjoern Marzahn, Hamburg environment authority spokesman. Traffic signs which ban diesel cars are installed by workers at the Max-Brauer Allee in downtown Hamburg, Germany May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian BimmerEnvironmentalists say the measures in Hamburg do not go far enough because they target only selected streets where air monitoring stations are in place. They worry that diversions will only prompt car owners to drive longer distances. “There are only four monitoring stations in Hamburg and it is evaluated according to their results, although the European Union limits are breached in many parts of the city,” Paul Schmid, spokesman for the Environment and Nature Conservation Association (BUND) in Hamburg, said. The court has promised a final statement by the end of this week, Marzahn said, adding that no fines will be levied during an initial phase of the ban, allowing drivers to get used to it. The city had considered other alternatives to improve air quality, such as deploying electric buses, but concluded that a partial diesel ban would be the most effective solution. “We as environment authorities are responsible for air purity and it’s our responsibility to make sure inhabitants don’t get sick (because of pollution),” Marzahn said. “I believe there is sympathy for this from car drivers.” Reporting by Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Peter GraffOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Hamburg takes steps to impose Germany's first big city ban on old diesels,W

Trump, who often complains of critical media coverage, did not mention the tweet by Roseanne Barr on Tuesday that compared black Obama administration adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape. The posting led ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co, to cancel its hit revival of her “Roseanne” sitcom. Jarrett said Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger called her before ABC announced the show’s cancellation. Trump on Wednesday night tweeted that Iger never apologized to him for “the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” On Thursday, he targeted the executive again on Twitter: “Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!” The president singled out Ross, an ABC News journalist who reported erroneously in December that Trump’s fired national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was prepared to testify that Trump had asked him to contact Russian officials during his presidential campaign. The report came out after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. The White House said on Wednesday it did not defend the racist tweet by Barr, a Trump supporter. Trump has remained silent on that topic. In the past, the Republican president has cited the program’s popularity as evidence that his supporters, who include Barr, want shows that speak to their concerns.

Barr said in a series of Tweets on Tuesday and early on Wednesday that what she did was “unforgiveable” when she posted on Twitter that if the Islamist political movement “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = vj,” referring to Valerie Jarrett, a former aide to President Barack Obama. “It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting-it was memorial day too-i went 2 far & do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible,” she wrote. “I made a mistake I wish I hadn’t but...don’t defend it please.” In other Tweets, Barr said that she was tired of “being attacked and belittled more than other comedians who have said worse” and asked for people not to boycott ABC, saying that the network has the right to “do what they wish.” Walt Disney Co’s ABC network on Tuesday canceled her popular U.S. television comedy “Roseanne” after her tweet. Barr, 65, then apologized “for making a bad joke” about Jarrett, who is black and was born in Iran to American parents. “Don’t feel sorry for me, guys!!,” Barr said in a Tweet late on Tuesday. “I just want to apologize to the hundreds of people, and wonderful writers (all liberal) and talented actors who lost their jobs on my show due to my stupid tweet.” Jarrett, 61, said on Tuesday that Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger called her before ABC announced the show’s cancellation. Hollywood talent agency ICM said in a statement on Tuesday it will no longer represent Barr. Several networks said it was removing reruns of her show. Hulu said episodes of the new show would no longer be available on its streaming service. The original “Roseanne” ran from 1988 to 1997, featuring a blue-collar family, the Conners, with overweight parents struggling to get by. It was praised for its realistic portrayal of working-class life. The current “Roseanne” was ABC’s biggest hit of the 2017-2018 season, drawing an average 18.7 million viewers, second only to CBS sitcom “The Big Bang Theory,” according to Nielsen data through May 20.

Service on what Singapore Airlines says will be the longest commercial flight in the world begins on Oct. 11. The flights will become daily beginning on Oct. 18.Contrast that to the shortest regularly scheduled commercial flight, a one-and-a-half-minute hop between Westray and Papa Westray, two islands north of the Scottish mainland, by Loganair.Singapore Airlines will be the first airline to use Airbus‚s A350-900 U.L.R. (for ultra long range) planes, which have extra fuel capacity, are made of a carbon fiber that is lighter than the aluminum of traditional jets and burn less fuel because they have only two engines, compared with the four on many other long-haul jets.The flights will have 161 seats ‚ 67 in lie-flat business class and 94 in premium economy, which uses bigger seats that have more legroom than traditional coach seats but do not have the ability to become a bed. The nonstop flight is primarily meant to appeal to business travelers, which is why Newark airport was chosen as the New York gateway. It gives the airline easy access to business customers in Manhattan and in northern New Jersey. ‚The nonstop flight length is at least about two to three hours shorter than the one stopper, maybe even four hours,‚ in terms of door-to-door travel time for most customers, said Mak Swee Wah, the airline‚s executive vice president, commercial. The company has not yet released pricing information.But on a flight that long, passenger comfort is a big issue.‚The thing that the passengers view as most important will be comfort,‚ Mr. Mak said.To that end, the airline is specially tailoring its in-flight meal service for the route. The exact schedule and menu options are still being decided, but the airline said that meal service on such a long flight takes more planning and orchestration than on shorter routes. As on other Singapore flights, travelers will be able to personalize what they watch with their seat-back entertainment system. Ahead of their flights, passengers will be able to create a playlists of movies, television shows and music that will be available onboard. The playlists will sync with their seat-back screens, and will even carry over to the return flight ‚ no need on the return flight to fast-forward through a movie half-watched on the outbound leg.‚This latest generation of planes has inbuilt features which enhance wellness,‚ Mr. Mak said. Because the plane is not made of aluminum, which is more susceptible to corrosion than carbon fiber, the cabin can be kept at higher humidity.A350 cabins are also pressurized at a lower altitude than usual, so passengers feel as if they are flying at only 6,000 feet. (Most airplanes are pressurized to 8,000 feet.) The cabin features an LED lighting system that can mimic different times of the day, helping customers combat jet lag before they even reset their watches or sync their phones to a new time zone. ‚What makes the airplane perfect for this kind of mission, first of all, is that it‚s capable of doing it,‚ said Marisa Lucas Ugena, Airbus‚s head of A350 product marketing. ‚The key factor for Singapore Airlines is that this aircraft is extremely efficient. It‚s allowing them to reopen this service and make money on it.‚The airline previously flew nonstop service on Airbus A340-500s between Newark and Singapore from 2004 to 2013. Beginning in 2008, the flight carried 100 business class seats. Before that, it was a two-class configuration, more similar to the layout planned for the October reboot.‚It was a product that was very well received,‚ Mr. Mak said. ‚Unfortunately, the economics at that time were challenging. The A340 was not the most efficient plane, and a number of other factors made it not economical to carry on.‚ Those Airbus A340s were configured to make the New York-to-Singapore flights possible and relatively cost-effective, but that meant it was not economical to use them on any other routes. So when Singapore Airlines ended the route in 2013, those planes were also pulled from service. The new A350s are more integrated into the Singapore Airlines fleet.‚Being part of the larger pool makes the economics of the operation more sound,‚ Mr. Mak said.In recent years, there has been a surge in ultra-long-haul flights as low fuel prices and new aircraft that are lighter weight and more efficient have made them cheaper to operate than before. Ten years ago, there were 10 ultra-long-haul flights, according to Samuel Engel, the senior vice president of aviation at the consulting group ICF. Today, there are 23 such routes in service, with more set to start in the coming months. He considers a flight to be ultra-long-haul if it travels more than 8,000 miles nonstop or takes more than 15 hours.‚This really is a case of the technology opening up new possibilities to the economics,‚ Mr. Engel said. And people have always been fascinated with the idea of traveling to far-off places, he added.‚We‚re partly fascinated by the magic of being able to teleport yourself to Kowloon, as it were,‚ he said, referring to the area of Hong Kong, ‚in a good night‚s sleep and a movie.‚",18 Hours and 45 Minutes: Longest Commercial Flight Returns to Service,"May 30, 2018 /  5:11 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-air-long-haul/singapore-airlines-to-launch-worlds-longest-commercial-flight-in-october-idUSKCN1IV0E1,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIAL.SI) said it would launch the world’s longest commercial flight in October, a near-19 hour non-stop journey from Singapore to the New York area.

Airlines including Singapore Airlines, Australia’s Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX) and U.S.-based United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) are adding ultra-long haul flights that can capture an airfare premium of around 20 percent versus flights involving one or more stops. The Singapore-Newark flight marks the return of a popular route for Singapore Airlines. The carrier had flown the marathon flights until 2013, when high fuel prices made the use of four-engine Airbus SE (AIR.PA) A340-500 jets uneconomic. It has since flown to New York’s JFK Airport via Frankfurt. Singapore Airlines is Airbus’ first and to date only customer for the A350-900ULR, an ultra-long range version of the fuel-efficient twin-engine A350 jet.  Qantas has said it is considering the purchase of the A350-900ULR or Boeing Co’s (BA.N) 777X to allow it to fly non-stop from Sydney to London from 2022, an even longer 9,200 nautical mile journey. Singapore Airlines said on Wednesday that it also plans to introduce non-stop flights from Singapore to Los Angeles with the A350-900ULR at a later date.

The homeless people clustered in tents along the railroad tracks. Boarded-up storefronts on cracked sidewalks. Gang violence.Now, Stockton hopes to make itself an exhibition ground for elevated fortunes through a simple yet unorthodox experiment. It is readying plans to deliver $500 a month in donated cash to perhaps 100 local families, no strings attached. The trial could start as soon as the fall and continue for about two years.As the first American city to test so-called universal basic income, Stockton will watch what happens next. So will governments and social scientists around the world as they explore how to share the bounty of capitalism more broadly at a time of rising economic inequality. Will single mothers use their cash to pay for child care so they can attend college? Will people confronting choices between buying school supplies or paying their electric bills gain a measure of security? Will families add healthier food to their diets? Basic income is a term that gets thrown around loosely, but the gist is that the government distributes cash universally. As the logic runs, if everyone gets money ‚ rich and poor, the employed and the jobless ‚ it removes the stigma of traditional welfare schemes while ensuring sustenance for all.That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state‚s political primaries in June, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality.The concept of basic income has been gaining adherents from Europe to Africa to North America as a potential stabilizer in the face of a populist insurrection tearing at the post-World War II liberal economic order. It is being embraced by social thinkers seeking to reimagine capitalism to more justly distribute its gains, and by technologists concerned about the job-destroying power of their creations.In various guises, the idea has captivated activists and intellectuals for centuries. In the 1500s, Thomas More‚s novel ‚Utopia‚ advanced the suggestion that thieves would be better deterred by public assistance than fear of a death sentence. In more modern times, Milton Friedman, darling of laissez-faire economics, embraced the idea of negative income taxes that put cash in the hands of the poorest people. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. advocated ‚the guaranteed income.‚Dr. King‚s legacy has currency in Stockton, which is now led by a history-making mayor, Michael Tubbs. At 27, he is the youngest mayor of a sizable American city, and the first African-American to hold the job here.Mr. Tubbs grew up in South Stockton, where payday lenders and pawn shops exploit the desperation of working poor people. His father was in prison for gang-related crime. His mother worked in medical customer service and struggled to pay bills, relying on welfare and food stamps.His mother kept him inside, his nose in his school books, fearful of the pitfalls beyond the door.He recalls standing at the mailbox tearing open a college acceptance letter while police cars massed down the block, lights flashing, as a neighbor‚s son was arrested for dealing drugs.Many of the adults around him were juggling multiple jobs, yet still living under the tyranny of unpaid bills. ‚People were working themselves to death,‚ Mr. Tubbs said. ‚Not working to live a good life, but working just to survive.‚ He enrolled at Stanford University. In his high school yearbook, friends scribbled congratulations for his having ‚made it from here.‚He was an intern in President Barack Obama‚s White House. After graduating from college in 2012, he taught ethnic studies, government and society at a charter high school while serving on the Stockton City Council.On the same day that President Trump was elected, voters in this city of 300,000 people put Mr. Tubbs in charge.Working but StrugglingForged as a supply hub during the Gold Rush of the 19th century, Stockton evolved into a center for migrant workers who toil in the fruit and vegetable farms of California‚s Central Valley. By the new millennium, it had become a bedroom community offering affordable homes for people who worked in unaffordable places like San Francisco and Silicon Valley, as far as two hours away.The crash in housing prices played out savagely here. The local unemployment rate reached 19 percent in early 2011. Stockton descended into bankruptcy. As Mr. Tubbs took office, nearly one in four local residents was officially poor. The median household income was about $46,000 ‚ roughly one-fourth below the national level. Only 17 percent of adults 25 and older had graduated from college. People were perpetually vulnerable to mundane calamities like auto troubles that kept them from getting to work. ‚Poverty is the biggest issue,‚ the mayor said. ‚Everything we deal with stems from that. There‚s so many people working incredibly hard, and if life happens, there‚s no bottom.‚Once he took office, his staff recommended basic income as a potential means of attacking poverty, one that was starting to gain traction around the world.In contrast to government programs that stipulate how money must be spent, basic income is supposed to deliver regular payments without restrictions. It amounts to a bet that poor people know the most appropriate use for a dollar better than bureaucrats. Rather than filling out forms and waiting to see case workers, people can devote their effort to looking for work, gaining skills or spending time with their children.On the other side of the world, Finland was starting a pilot project. Just down the freeway in Oakland, the start-up incubator, Y Combinator, was conducting a trial. The Canadian province of Ontario was preparing for an experiment. A nonprofit organization, GiveDirectly, was giving cash grants to poor people in rural Kenya. All of these trials confronted various forms of skepticism, bringing warnings that unconditional cash would replace paychecks with the dole. Finland recently opted not to expand its basic income experiment.In the United States, a program supplying $10,000 a year to every American would cost $3 trillion. Even some proponents of expanding the social safety net oppose the idea, fearing it would siphon money away from existing programs.Still, as the traditional promise of work breaks down, unconventional ideas are emerging from the political margins to gain a serious airing.At a conference in San Francisco last spring, Mr. Tubbs was introduced to Natalie Foster, a co-founder of the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group formed to advance the concept of universal basic income. The project included Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder.Within the Silicon Valley crowd, basic income had become a fashionable idea for addressing collective angst over the social consequences of technology. The masters of innovation were becoming stupendously rich via creations poised to make working people poor, replacing human labor with robots. Basic income was posited as compensation. The Economic Security Project was keen to demonstrate another aspect of basic income ‚ its potential to help communities facing problems in the here and now. It was shopping for a city that could serve as staging ground. ‚It‚s important that people see this as possible,‚ Ms. Foster said. ‚Cities are laboratories of democracy.‚Stockton was diverse, with more than 40 percent of its residents Hispanic, some 20 percent Asian, and 14 percent African-American. More than half of the working-age people in surrounding San Joaquin County earned the minimum wage. The city was in the hands of a social media-savvy mayor who could help spread the word.Ms. Foster‚s group agreed to deliver $1 million for a new project ‚ SEED, for Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration.The sum was nowhere near enough to finance universal anything. It would not cover the basics of any critical need.Still, it could produce a glimpse of what a guaranteed cash program might look like.The city commissioned artists to paint murals in the center of town, celebrating basic income as the next phase of the civil rights struggle advanced by Dr. King.Who Deserves A Hand?As city leaders formulate the details of the project, they are wrestling with a foundational question: Are they running a legitimate social science experiment, or engineering a demonstration of basic income‚s virtues?The answer directs how they distribute the cash. If it is primarily a display, then only the most responsible people should be given cash. But if it is about science, the money must be dispensed more randomly, with the likelihood that some people will waste it on drugs.At a meeting at City Hall, the SEED project manager Lori Ospina urged that the program be designed to yield valid scientific data. That involves choosing participants on the basis of narrow demographic criteria ‚ perhaps their age, their race, their income.But that approach could expose the city to charges that the program is not inclusive enough. ‚The trolls I‚ve been dealing with on social media and in real life have very racialized views of how this is going to work,‚ Mr. Tubbs said. ‚As the first black mayor of this city, it would be very dangerous if the only people to get this were black.‚He wants to select participants who are most likely to spend their money wisely, generating stories of working poor people lifted by extra cash. People like Shay Holliman.As a child, her mother was incarcerated. She was raised by her grandmother, along with nine other children. They crammed into apartments full of cockroaches, moving from state to state to stay ahead of the bill collectors.She had a baby. She worked at McDonald‚s, but she lacked reliable child care, making the job impossible. She could not pay rent on her $600 a month welfare check. One night, she found herself walking the Stockton streets, her infant daughter in a carrier against her chest, pulling two suitcases full of everything she owned.Taking shelter with a sister consumed by drug addiction, she fell into a vortex of violence.

(Reuters) - Michael Tubbs, the 27-year-old mayor of Stockton, California, has a radical plan to combat poverty in his cash-strapped city: a “no strings” guaranteed basic income of $500 a month for its residents. Starting in early 2019, Tubbs plans to provide the monthly stipend to a select group of residents as part of a privately funded 18-month experiment to assess how people use the money.  “And then, maybe, in two or three years, we can have a much more informed discussion about the social safety net, the income floor people deserve and the best way to do it because we’ll have more data and research,” Tubbs told Reuters. The city has not yet decided how many people will receive income from the trial project, which is funded by The Economic Security Project, a philanthropic network co-chaired by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. The idea of governments providing a universal basic income to their citizens has been gaining traction globally. The Finnish government is running a two-year trial to provide 2,000 unemployed people with monthly payments of approximately $660. In Alaska, each resident has long received an annual dividend check from oil revenues from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which Tubbs said is a model for his approach. Last year, the payout in Alaska was $1,100.   The Economic Security Project is providing $1 million to fund the Stockton trial after approaching Tubbs to ask if his city would be interested in piloting a basic income program. “I jumped at the opportunity,” said Tubbs, who was familiar with the concept from the writings of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Hughes, 34, has proposed the U.S. government give a guaranteed income of $500 a month to every working American earning less than $50,000 a year, at a total cost of $290 billion a year. He says a 50-percent tax rate on income and capital gains for Americans earning more than $250,000 would pay for it.  ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT The issue of economic empowerment is a personal one for Tubbs. Growing up in Stockton, where one in four residents live in poverty, his family relied on government assistance to meet their basic needs.

REUTERS/Jane Ross“My mom was on welfare for the first five, six years of my life,” he said. “You’d get food stamps, but that’s not cash, and maybe food’s not the biggest need ... So this gives people more agency to kind of make the best decision.”  The scheme is not without its detractors. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development argues that providing an unconditional basic income to everyone of working age would do little to combat poverty if not funded by extra taxes. Critics also say it would encourage people not to look for work. Finland’s government has opted not to extend that country’s two-year trial when it ends next December. Some lawmakers and economists had argued the scheme was too expensive and narrow to yield credible conclusions. For 31-year-old Shay Holliman, though, an extra $500 a month would just allow her to make ends meet. She was recently released from prison after an 11-year sentence and works a 9-5 job at a local nonprofit then drives for Uber and Lyft in the evenings and at weekends.  “I still can’t pay all my bills,” she said.  ‘MORAL RESPONSIBILITY’ The criteria for participation in the experiment has not yet been decided, Tubbs said. But already, he has been receiving letters and emails from residents asking to be considered.  Tubbs says he “felt almost a moral responsibility” to do something “a little bit out the box” for his city of 300,000 east of San Francisco.  “And I know, for me, I want to live in a community where people’s basic needs are met,” he said. Trena Turner, a pastor and executive director of community organization Faith in the Valley, who deals with economically disadvantaged people, hopes the experiment will change the way people see Stockton, which declared bankruptcy in 2012 and has high rates of crime and homelessness.

The employees will not be obligated to continue working for Walmart after they get their degrees, and must put up only $1 a day toward the cost of classes. ‚We feel like this is another step forward in investing in our associates,‚ said Julie Murphy, an executive vice president in Walmart‚s United States operation.Walmart, the country‚s largest employer, introduced the tuition subsidy as it seeks ways to retain workers at a time of low unemployment. Employers like Starbucks and Amazon also offer tuition support.Walmart, which has faced criticism over low pay and poor working conditions, is also trying to burnish its image while expanding its presence in more upscale markets online.This year, Walmart raised its base wage $2, to $11 an hour, and expanded its maternity and family leave benefits. The company has also begun offering lower-level store managers more job training programs called ‚Walmart Academies,‚ where employees learn basic management skills and graduate in ceremonies wearing caps and gowns.Thom Arnold, 32, who has been working at Walmart since high school, said he would ‚love to take advantage‚ of the tuition subsidy. Mr. Arnold, who was chosen by his store in Staunton, Va., to attend the shareholder meeting, said he would like to pursue a career in cybersecurity.‚I‚d like to advance into something bigger,‚ he said.Activists groups ‚ including Organization United for Respect Walmart, which was staging demonstrations in Bentonville through the week ‚ argue that the company should raise hourly wages to at least $15, a figure that Walmart‚s rival Target has committed to. Another group, Making Change at Walmart, a project affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said it was skeptical of Walmart‚s promises and pointed out that the company had announced its wage increases the same day that word spread of the planned closing of 63 Sam‚s Club stores.‚At best, if this is more than a publicity stunt, then Walmart is merely playing catch-up to other multibillion-dollar companies when it comes to providing benefits to its workers,‚ the group‚s director, Randy Parraz, said in a statement.Walmart officials did not provide an estimated cost for the tuition subsidy, but they expected that about 68,000 employees would probably enroll during the first five years, based on those who have expressed interest and an analysis of similar programs in other industries.The University of Florida is probably the best known of the universities in the Walmart program. Brandman University, which has multiple campuses in California and an online curriculum, has a focus on Hispanic students. The billionaire investor Joe Ricketts, who founded TD Ameritrade, is among Bellevue University‚s benefactors.Walmart said its goal was to help employees obtain a college degree without having to take out loans. Walmart workers enrolled in the program would not be required to pay for their education upfront and seek reimbursement later. When Starbucks first announced its tuition subsidy and a partnership with Arizona State University in 2014, the company was criticized for pushing the risk onto its workers by making them pay up front.Walmart workers will qualify for the benefit after 90 days of employment and will not be penalized if they leave the company before finishing their studies.The tuition subsidy will apply only to associate and bachelor‚s degrees in two programs that are somewhat related to retail work, but the areas of study could be expanded to other areas in the future, Walmart officials said.",Walmart Says It Will Pay for Its Workers to Earn College Degrees,"May 25, 2018 /  3:16 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-walmart-workers/half-of-walmarts-workforce-are-part-time-workers-labor-group-idUSKCN1IQ295,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Part-time workers account for half of Walmart Inc’s (WMT.N) workforce, up from 20 percent in 2005, according to a labor group report on Friday that examined the company’s increased shift away from more expensive full-time employees.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoThe report from the Organization United for Respect (OUR), formerly called OUR Walmart, said 69 percent of the part-time employees it surveyed would prefer the stability and greater income of a full-time job. Walmart’s share of part-time workers is well above the industry average of around 30 percent, it  said. Over 7,000 Walmart hourly employees participated in the survey. The responses were collated online from 87 percent of them, or 6,176 current employees, the report said. OUR, which split from the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) in 2015, says it is a network of over 150,000 people working in low wage retail jobs and its largest support base is within Walmart. The retailer’s spokesman, Kory Lundberg, said the company has a majority full-time hourly workforce, without giving numbers. “We have more full-time jobs than any private business in America and we have seen that percentage go up over the last few years.”  Lundberg said the company converts about 150,000 workers from part time to full time annually and employees can pick up  extra hours by signing up for eligible unfilled shifts in their stores.

REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File photo                      Part-time employees receive fewer benefits, earn less pay for the same work as full-time associates and often find it hard to climb the ranks within the company.  According to research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 9 percent of part-time workers prefer full-time jobs. Labor experts say that number takes into account a broad cross-section of the industry and not the specific subset of minimum wage workers that make up much of Walmart’s ranks.  Walmart employs around 1.5 million people in the United States and is the largest private employer in the country. The company raised its minimum wage for hourly employees to $11 an hour in January, its third minimum wage increase since 2005, after benefiting from the corporate tax cut plan.   The company is gearing up for its annual shareholders meeting next week, a celebrity-studded affair that draws  thousands of workers from around the world. OUR and other labor groups annually release reports before the shareholder meeting.  Four out of five part-time black, Latino and Asian hourly Walmart employees who participated in the survey described themselves as “involuntary part-time” employees - those who would prefer to work full-time - the survey showed. About 60 percent of the part-time workers surveyed also said their hours declined after Walmart launched a new scheduling system in 2016. Arianna Smith, a Walmart employee in Barstow, California,  said her hours had been cut. “I went from working more than 40 hours a week at $11 an hour to being scheduled for only 16-24 hours each week.” Guirlene Mazarin, who works at Walmart’s store in Miami Gardens, Florida, said her part-time schedule is random. “Even though I am available to work additional hours, I’m only scheduled for approximately 30 hours every week,” she said. Mazar said her schedule prevents her from planning for the week, adding a second part-time job or being available to pick up her daughter from school. Fifty-five percent of part-time employees also said they did not have enough food to meet their basic needs. Walmart employees are among the largest groups on food stamp subsidies, according to labor experts.

The new guidelines, from the American Cancer Society, would extend routine colorectal cancer screening to an additional 22 million American adults between the ages of 45 and 49 and send a clear message that colorectal cancer, which has been rising in young adults, is no longer just a disease of older people.Dr. Thomas Weber, who is the co-chairman of an early-age onset colon cancer task group for the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable but who was not involved in writing the new recommendation, called lowering the age for first screening ‚a game changer‚ that could save thousands of lives.‚This is a very, very big deal,‚ said Dr. Weber, who is director of surgical oncology for the northwest region of Northwell Health. ‚Solid epidemiological data from our national cancer registries documents a dramatic increase in the incidence of colon and especially rectal cancer among individuals under the age of 50, and the vast majority of those cases are in the 40- to 49-year-old age bracket.‚ The guidelines, released Wednesday, were published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. They do not call for everyone to have a colonoscopy, the gold standard of colon cancer screening. Rather, to maximize the chances that people will take up screening, the cancer society wants physicians to offer patients a choice of six different screening options, from the most invasive procedure, colonoscopy, which can be done every 10 years, to lab tests done on stool samples that can be collected at home, which must be repeated more often and followed by colonoscopy if results are positive. The group estimates some 16,450 new cases of colon or rectal cancers will be diagnosed this year in Americans under 50.In 2014, 43 percent of colorectal cancer cases in those under 50 were in adults aged 45 to 49, according to Rebecca L. Siegel, an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society and the lead author of several reports showing a rise in colorectal cancers in adults as young as their 20s and 30s. The group does not recommend routine screening for those under 45 because the absolute rates of cancer in those age groups are still very low and there are risks associated with procedures like colonoscopies, including a perforated bowel. Over 140,000 Americans are expected to be given a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer this year. The disease leads to over 50,000 deaths annually, making it the second leading cause of cancer fatalities among American adults.The vast majority of colorectal cancers are still found in older people, with nearly 90 percent of all cases diagnosed in people over 50. But while incidence and deaths among those 55 and older have been declining in recent decades, at least in part because of screening that results in removal of precancerous polyps and early detection of cancer, recent analyses have documented a 50 percent rise in colorectal cancer rates among adults under 50 between 1994 and 2014.  While colorectal cancer rates dropped steadily for people born between 1890 and 1950, they have been increasing for every generation born since 1950. A recent American Cancer Society study by Dr. Siegel found that adults born in 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer compared to the risk adults born in 1950 faced at a comparable age.For younger adults like Gale Fritsche, now 55, of Allentown, Pa., existing recommendations fell short. Mr. Fritsche went in for his first screening colonoscopy at 50 but discovered he already had advanced colon cancer.‚I went in there not thinking there‚s going to be a problem, and I wake up with two doctors standing over me saying, ‚We have an issue,‚‚ said Mr. Fritsche, a competitive athlete who said he follows a healthy diet and has no family history of colon cancer. ‚If screening had started five years earlier, my cancer might have been caught at the really early stages and not been as advanced as it was.‚ The new guideline puts the American Cancer Society at odds with other national organizations that recommend starting screening at 50, and raises questions about whether health insurers will pay for the earlier tests.The influential Preventive Services Task Force decided against lowering the screening age to 45 when it updated its recommendations in 2016, and continues to recommend starting routine screening at 50. The Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, which includes representatives from several gastroenterology groups, urges African-Americans to start routine screening at 45 because they carry a higher burden of colorectal cancer but advises others at average risk to start screening at 50. The American Cancer Society acknowledges that the evidence for screening in those under 50 is not as robust as for those 50 and older, but say it is compelling nonetheless. The group also says that screenings should continue through age 75 but that decisions for those over 75 should be individualized based on patient preference, life expectancy and health status. The message to both the general public and to physicians is that ‚colorectal cancer can occur at any age,‚ even among teenagers, said Dr. Richard C. Wender, chief cancer control officer for the American Cancer Society. ‚If you‚re losing weight or have bowel changes or have symptoms like blood in your stool, you need an answer as to why.‚ He noted that though hemorrhoids are one cause of rectal bleeding, they are less common in younger people and ‚there‚s no such thing as normal rectal bleeding.‚ ‚What‚s really important is for physicians to be aware,‚ said Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist who is co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal Cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which is dedicated solely to treating patients under 50. ‚Many of our young patients say, ‚Well I saw five doctors who said it was hemorrhoids and thought I was too young to have cancer.‚ One of our main goals is to get the word out to all the physicians who are seeing these people first.‚  ",Cancer Group Calls for Colorectal Cancer Screening Starting at Age 45,"May 30, 2018 /  5:27 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-health-cancer/american-cancer-society-recommends-earlier-colorectal-cancer-screening-idUSL3N1T15HK,"May 30 (Reuters) - The American Cancer Society is recommending that people at average risk of colorectal cancer start regular screening at age 45 rather than at 50, at a time when studies show a rise in cases of the disease among younger individuals. The new ACS guideline here also recommends people, who are in good health and with a life expectancy of more than 10 years, should continue regular colorectal cancer screening through the age of 75. The guideline suggests screening either through a high sensitivity stool-based test or visual examination such as colonoscopy. Shares of diagnostic company Exact Sciences Corp, which makes Cologuard that helps detect colorectal cancer, jumped more than 10 percent after the guideline was revealed. “While we commend the ACS for its forward thinking ... we do not believe this will necessarily be a big driver of Cologuard volume upside for Exact Sciences in the near term,” William Blair analyst Brian Weinstein said. The move comes as a recent stud here showed that there has been a marked increase in colorectal cancer incidence, particularly rectal cancer, among younger individuals. Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women in the United States and is expected to cause about 50,630 deaths during 2018, according to ACS. The most common screening method is a colonoscopy exam that snakes a tiny camera through the rectum to view the colon to search for abnormal tissue growth. An alternative is fecal occult blood testing, which looks for blood — a possible sign of cancer — in stool samples.

If successful, it would temper border hostilities between nuclear-armed neighbors in a disputed region that has recently witnessed some of its worst violence in years. On Wednesday, a tense calm settled on the border separating the Indian-controlled part of the region, known as Jammu and Kashmir, from the Pakistani-held area. Civilians displaced by the violence cautiously contemplated returning to their homes on Wednesday, waiting to see whether violence would resume. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in recent years along the straggling boundary, which stretches for about 1,200 miles. Cross-border shelling has been a weekly part of life. Eager to restart their lives and return home, many were hopeful that the truce would stick, but not confident.‚For the last six to seven months the firing has been very intense and we can‚t live in our village,‚ Isher Singh, a 72-year-old farmer whose village is about half a mile from the disputed border, said in a telephone interview.Mr. Singh, like thousands of others, has lived on and off in government-run camps because of the cross-border shelling. His family has lived through decades of violence and survived the three wars India and Pakistan have fought over Kashmir.‚We can‚t do our agriculture, we can‚t rear our animals and our children can‚t go to school,‚ he said. ‚Our lives become hell during the firing. We are happy with this cease-fire news and hope it will last.‚The nascent agreement follows a rare cease-fire announced by the Indian Army in Kashmir for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends mid-June. That cease-fire is the first Ramadan truce in 18 years. On Tuesday night, India and Pakistan‚s top military commanders brokered the new truce via a telephone hotline, promising to restore ‚in letter and spirit‚ a 2003 truce agreement, according to near-identical statements released by both sides.

FILE PHOTO: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh attend a news conference in Srinagar, June 7, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Ismail The Hindu nationalist BJP entered into an unlikely alliance with a regional party after an inconclusive election in 2014 to govern the Muslim-majority state, which is claimed by neighboring Pakistan and where Indian forces have struggled to quell a revolt for decades.   “It has become untenable for the BJP to continue in the alliance government in Jammu and Kashmir,” Ram Madhav, party general secretary, told reporters. Madhav said the security situation in the state had worsened and it should be put under “governor’s rule”, or direct rule from New Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a general election earlier in 2014, vowing to end the insurgency in Kashmir but militant violence has worsened in recent months. Last week, India rejected a U.N. report that accused it of having used excessive force in Kashmir to kill and wound civilians since 2016. The United Nations also called for an international inquiry into accusations of rights violations. Direct rule by the central government would give the BJP a free hand to control the state ahead of a general election that must be called within a year. Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, of the regional People’s Democratic Party (PDP), said she had resigned and that her party would not seek the support of other parties to restore a majority. “A muscular policy will not work here,” she told reporters. The BJP has long favored a tough approach to quell the revolt, while the PDP had advocated a softer touch to address the grievances in the state where tens of people have been killed since the insurgency began in 1989. More than 130 people have died in escalating violence in Kashmir this year. Last week, gunmen shot dead a prominent newspaper editor in the state capital, Srinagar, who had been a strong advocate of peace in the region. Both India and Pakistan lay claim to Kashmir and have twice gone to war over it since independence from Britain in 1947. India blames Pakistan for fomenting the rebellion in its only Muslim-majority state. Pakistan says it only provides moral support to the insurgency.  Any intensification of the insurgency or deterioration of the situation in Kashmir carries the risk of prompting confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbors. This month, the federal government ordered a suspension of operations against militants during the holy month of Ramadan, a concession promoted by Chief Minister Mehbooba of the PDP.  But militant attacks continued, weakening her hand and the truce was lifted soon after the fasting month ended. “Basically, keeping in mind the larger national interest of India’s integrity and security, in order to bring control over the situation prevailing in the state, we have decided that it is time the reins of power be handed over to the state governor,” Madhav said.

REUTERS/Danish IsmailSyed Shujaat Bukhari, editor of the Rising Kashmir newspaper, was leaving his office in the city center of Srinagar when he was shot by three assailants on motorbikes, Senior Superintendent of Police Imtiyaz Ismail told Reuters. Bukhari, who was given police protection following an attack on him 18 years ago, was hit by multiple bullets fired at a close range, Ismail said. There was no immediate word from police on the identity or possible motive of the gunmen. Bukhari had been a strong advocate of peace in disputed Kashmir, at the heart of decades of hostility between India and Pakistan, both of which claim the Muslim majority region.  India had suspended operations against militants fighting its rule in Kashmir during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan which began last month, after weeks of sporadic violence there. Wife of Syed Shujaat Bukhari, the editor-in-chief of local newspaper ""Rising Kashmir"", who according to local media was killed by unidentified gunmen outside his office in Srinagar, mourns during his funeral in Kreeri, north of Srinagar, June 15, 2018. REUTERS/Danish IsmailWaseem Ahmad, a local journalist, told Reuters that he heard gunfire ringing out and, reaching the location, found Bukhari and his two guards lying in a pool of blood in their car. “Extremely shocking news,” said Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, who broke down in front of cameras. “Terrorism has hit a new low with Shujaat’s killing,” Mufti said on Twitter. “We must unite against forces seeking to undermine our attempts to restore peace. Justice will be done.” Slideshow (7 Images)Bukhari had been part of India’s delegation for informal peace talks on Kashmir with Pakistani representatives held in Dubai last year. He was instrumental in organizing several conferences for Kashmir peace. Condemnation of his killing in Srinagar, the summer capital of India’s Jammu and Kashmir state, and condolences poured in from across the country. Calling Bukhari a fearless journalist, Indian Interior Minister Rajnath Singh said on Twitter the killing was an act of cowardice and “an attempt to silence the saner voices of Kashmir”. More than 130 people have been killed this year in militant violence in Kashmir. “Forces inimical to restoring peace in the Kashmir valley have silenced a voice of reason, logic and peace,” the Press Club of India said in a statement, mourning the loss of Bukhari.     India has long accused Pakistan of training and arming militants and helping them infiltrate across the heavily militarized Line of Control (LoC) that separates the two sides in the region, a charge Islamabad denies. The attack on Bukhari coincided with discussions being held over an extension of a ceasefire by security forces in Kashmir. Earlier, India rejected a U.N. report that accused it of having used excessive force in disputed Kashmir to kill and wound civilians since 2016, and which called for an international inquiry into accusations of rights violations.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks with the media during his visit at Janaki Mandir, a Hindu temple dedicated to goddess Sita, in Janakpur, Nepal May 11, 2018. REUTERS/Navesh ChitrakarThe 330 megawatt Kishanganga hydropower station, work on which started in 2009, is one of the projects that India has fast-tracked in the volatile state amid frosty ties between the nuclear-armed countries. “This region can not only become self-sufficient in power but also produce for other regions of the country,” Modi said in the state’s capital, Srinagar. “Keeping that in mind we have been working on various projects here in the past four years.” Pakistan has opposed some of these projects, saying they violate a World Bank-mediated treaty on the sharing of the Indus river and its tributaries upon which 80 percent of its irrigated agriculture depends. “Pakistan is seriously concerned about the inauguration (of the Kishanganga plant),” its foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. “Pakistan believes that the inauguration of the project without the resolution of the dispute is tantamount to violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).” The Kishanganga project was delayed for several years as Pakistan dragged India to the International Court of Arbitration, which ruled in India’s favor in 2013. India has said the hydropower projects underway in Jammu and Kashmir are “run-of-the-river” schemes that use the river’s flow and elevation to generate electricity rather than large reservoirs, and do not contravene the treaty. A day before Modi’s trip to the northern state, at least nine people were killed on both sides of the border due to firing by each other’s security forces, officials said. The two countries have fought three wars, two over Kashmir that they rule in part but claim in full. India accuses Pakistan of promoting militancy in Kashmir, a charge that Islamabad denies. Modi, who is on a day-long visit to the state, also flagged off the construction of the 14 km (9 mile)-long Zojila tunnel to provide all-weather connectivity between the cities of Srinagar, Kargil and Leh. The government said it would be the longest road tunnel in India and Asia’s longest two-way tunnel, to be constructed at a cost of $1 billion.

Mountainous Kashmir is divided between the nuclear-armed neighbors, who both claim it in full and have fought two of their three wars over the region since their separation in 1947. On Tuesday, their armies agreed to “fully implement” a 2003 ceasefire agreement. “In case of any issue, restraint will be exercised and the matter will be resolved through utilization of existing mechanisms of hotline contacts and border flag meetings at local commander’s level,” Pakistan’s military said in a statement. Bacchan Lal, the headman of Abdullian village in Jammu and Kashmir, who has been living in a college with 350 other people over the past two weeks, said such agreements rarely last long. “They agree to respect the ceasefire several times every year but then they violate it again.

Islamabad regularly denies Indian allegations that it trains and arms militants and helps them infiltrate across the so-called Line of Control that divides Kashmir.

Putin of Russia, documented the latest episode in his 13-year game of cat and mouse with the Russian government, live-tweeting his brief arrest by the Spanish police on Wednesday. Russia has repeatedly requested Mr. Browder‚s arrest through Interpol ‚ this was the sixth such attempt, he said ‚ but its requests have been refused repeatedly. In 2013, in a rare and sharp rebuke, Interpol said Russia‚s request to arrest Mr. Browder ‚was of a predominately political nature.‚ A spokesman for the Spanish national police said that Mr. Browder had been detained in error, and that police in Madrid realized the international warrant was no longer valid only after he had been taken into custody. ‚There is not, and never has been, a Red Notice for Mr. Bill Browder,‚ the Interpol media office said in an emailed statement. ‚Mr. Browder is not wanted via Interpol channels.‚Mr. Browder said he had been arrested while en route to testify to Spanish prosecutors about a corruption case involving Russian officials, and that he was released after the Interpol general secretary in Lyon, France, intervened on his behalf. Interpol, an organization of 190 countries is forbidden by its constitution from any action of a ‚political character.‚ This can make it difficult to obtain red notices, which amount to international arrest warrants. Russia has succeeded, however, in obtaining arrests through less formal ‚diffusions,‚ which allow member countries to feed requests into Interpol‚s computer system without real vetting. In some cases, Russia has timed diffusions for the precise moment when a target enters a certain country.Mr. Browder reflected in a 2016 interview that the Russian authorities were undeterred by failure. ‚The Russians try stuff a hundred times, and sometimes it works,‚ he said. ‚They can fail 99 times, but the 100th time it could work. For them, that makes it all worthwhile.‚Mr. Browder, who was once the largest foreign investor in the Russian stock market, ran afoul of Mr. Putin in 2005 and was kicked out of Russia. He was convicted of tax fraud by a Russian court in absentia and sentenced to nine years in prison. He documented Russia‚s efforts to arrest him in a 2015 book, ‚Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man‚s Fight for Justice.‚ Mr. Browder‚s lobbying took on moral force in 2009, when Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer for his company, Hermitage Capital, died of toxic shock and heart failure in a Moscow detention center, where he had been held for more than a year. While in detention, Mr. Magnitsky had meticulously documented his requests for medical care for pancreatitis and gall bladder disease, which were denied. The Russian authorities said he had never complained of health problems.Mr. Browder turned the lawyer‚s death into an international cause and succeeded in persuading Congress to pass a 2012 law, the Magnitsky Act, that barred Russian officials linked with his death from entering the United States or using its banking system. The European Parliament later passed its own version of the act, in a hearing that ended with a standing ovation for Mr. Browder.Mr. Browder was born in the United States but later renounced his American citizenship and became a citizen of Britain. His grandfather Earl Browder was the head of the American Communist Party. His father became a mathematics professor at the University of Chicago, and his brother, Thomas, is an eminent particle physicist.","Bill Browder, a Putin Critic, Live-Tweets His Arrest in Spain","June 15, 2018 /  5:06 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-sanctions-browder/kremlin-foe-bill-browder-tells-west-russian-money-is-putins-achilles-heel-idUSKBN1JB0E7,"LONDON (Reuters) - Once the biggest foreign money manager in Russia, Bill Browder has some advice for the West: If you want to counter Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin, then go after Russian money and Russian oligarchs. Browder, the British 54-year-old head of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, leads a campaign to expose corruption and punish Russian officials he blames for the 2009 death of Sergei Magnitsky who he employed as a lawyer. To American-born Browder, who made millions in Russian markets, the West is playing a poor game against Russia, which he casts as corrupt and ultimately weak by comparison. “With an incredibly bad hand, Putin is bluffing the hell out of the West,” Browder told Reuters at his offices in London. “If this is a poker analogy: Putin has a pair of twos, we have a full house and we are folding our cards.” The United States has a $20 trillion economy and the combined might of the G7 is nearly $40 trillion while Russia’s economy is worth about $1.7 trillion, smaller than Italy’s. Browder is lobbying Western governments to adopt a so-called Magnitsky Act to impose sanctions on Russian officials for corruption and rights abuses.  Western leaders were surprised by Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Moscow’s 2015 intervention in the Syrian civil war, and imposed sanctions on Russian officials and businessmen.  Since then, fears that Russia meddled in Western elections and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in England have prompted a debate in the West over how to deal with Putin, who has been Russia’s paramount leader since the end of 1999. Russia says Crimea was historically Russian, that claims of meddling in Western elections are an attempt to stoke anti-Russian hysteria and that it had nothing to do with the attack on former agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. Putin, a former KGB spy, has repeatedly said he wants peace with the West which he casts as the aggressor.  CHECKMATE  For Browder, the best way to counter Putin is to go after the hundreds of billions of dollars that hemorrhaged out of the former Soviet Union since its 1991 collapse. The British capital earned a nickname of “Londongrad” because it became the destination of choice for rich and middle class Russians, though Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated Britain will go after “dirty” money. “If you go after Putin’s money via the biggest oligarchs, as the U.S. has just started to do, that will stop him,” Browder said. “That is a checkmate situation.”  “If you want to go after Putin, go after his money and if you want to go after his money go after the oligarchs.” The U.S. Treasury in April imposed sanctions against billionaire Oleg Deripaska and the eight companies in which he is a large shareholder, including the world’s second largest aluminum producer, Rusal, in response to what it called “malign activities” by Russia. Some Russian tycoons, especially those who made their fortunes before Putin’s rise to power in 1999, say they have little to do with the Kremlin and that U.S. sanctions help Putin by forcing Russian capital back to Moscow. A Russian court sentenced Browder to nine years in prison in absentia in December after finding him guilty of deliberate bankruptcy and tax evasion. Browder, who has repeatedly dismissed the allegations, was briefly arrested in Spain last month before being released.  “I am much happier fighting for justice than I ever was fighting for money,” Browder said. “It is just a much more meaningful and satisfying life.  “I much more enjoy the company of freedom fighters and justice campaigners than I do the company of hedge fund managers.” (This story has been refiled to fix typo in lead) Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a news conference following a live nationwide broadcast call-in in Moscow, Russia June 7, 2018.

Putin of Russia, documented the latest episode in his 13-year game of cat and mouse with the Russian government, live-tweeting his brief arrest by the Spanish police on Wednesday. Russia has repeatedly requested Mr. Browder‚s arrest through Interpol ‚ this was the sixth such attempt, he said ‚ but its requests have been refused repeatedly. In 2013, in a rare and sharp rebuke, Interpol said Russia‚s request to arrest Mr. Browder ‚was of a predominately political nature.‚ A spokesman for the Spanish national police said that Mr. Browder had been detained in error, and that police in Madrid realized the international warrant was no longer valid only after he had been taken into custody. ‚There is not, and never has been, a Red Notice for Mr. Bill Browder,‚ the Interpol media office said in an emailed statement. ‚Mr. Browder is not wanted via Interpol channels.‚Mr. Browder said he had been arrested while en route to testify to Spanish prosecutors about a corruption case involving Russian officials, and that he was released after the Interpol general secretary in Lyon, France, intervened on his behalf. Interpol, an organization of 190 countries is forbidden by its constitution from any action of a ‚political character.‚ This can make it difficult to obtain red notices, which amount to international arrest warrants. Russia has succeeded, however, in obtaining arrests through less formal ‚diffusions,‚ which allow member countries to feed requests into Interpol‚s computer system without real vetting. In some cases, Russia has timed diffusions for the precise moment when a target enters a certain country.Mr. Browder reflected in a 2016 interview that the Russian authorities were undeterred by failure. ‚The Russians try stuff a hundred times, and sometimes it works,‚ he said. ‚They can fail 99 times, but the 100th time it could work. For them, that makes it all worthwhile.‚Mr. Browder, who was once the largest foreign investor in the Russian stock market, ran afoul of Mr. Putin in 2005 and was kicked out of Russia. He was convicted of tax fraud by a Russian court in absentia and sentenced to nine years in prison. He documented Russia‚s efforts to arrest him in a 2015 book, ‚Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man‚s Fight for Justice.‚ Mr. Browder‚s lobbying took on moral force in 2009, when Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer for his company, Hermitage Capital, died of toxic shock and heart failure in a Moscow detention center, where he had been held for more than a year. While in detention, Mr. Magnitsky had meticulously documented his requests for medical care for pancreatitis and gall bladder disease, which were denied. The Russian authorities said he had never complained of health problems.Mr. Browder turned the lawyer‚s death into an international cause and succeeded in persuading Congress to pass a 2012 law, the Magnitsky Act, that barred Russian officials linked with his death from entering the United States or using its banking system. The European Parliament later passed its own version of the act, in a hearing that ended with a standing ovation for Mr. Browder.Mr. Browder was born in the United States but later renounced his American citizenship and became a citizen of Britain. His grandfather Earl Browder was the head of the American Communist Party. His father became a mathematics professor at the University of Chicago, and his brother, Thomas, is an eminent particle physicist.","Bill Browder, a Putin Critic, Live-Tweets His Arrest in Spain","May 30, 2018 /  8:41 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-russia-arrest/putin-critic-browder-detained-then-freed-by-spanish-police-idUSKCN1IV0YL,"MADRID (Reuters) - British businessman Bill Browder, a prominent Kremlin critic, was detained and then released by Spanish police on Wednesday, after a warrant from Russia for his arrest for tax evasion was found to be invalid, police said. The head of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, Browder led a campaign to expose corruption and punish Russian officials he blames for the 2009 death of Sergei Magnitsky, who he employed as a lawyer. A Russian court sentenced Browder to nine years in prison in absentia in December after finding him guilty of deliberate bankruptcy and tax evasion. Browder said on his Twitter account that Interpol had advised Spanish police not to honor a Russian Interpol red notice - a request to locate and provisionally arrest someone pending extradition. “This is the sixth time that Russia has abused Interpol in my case,” he tweeted, following his release from a Madrid police station.  Browder had been held in police custody for the “minimum necessary time” and was released because the warrant issued by Russian authorities was invalid, Spanish police said in a statement on Twitter.  The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

REUTERS/Juan MedinaBrowder was in Madrid to give evidence to Jose Grinda, a Spanish prosecutor who spearheads investigations into organized crime, about money from the Magnitsky case that has flowed to Spain, the British businessman said on Twitter. He later posted a tweet and photograph of himself at Madrid’s Barajas airport saying he had cleared Spanish immigration without problems and was on his way back to London.  Magnitsky was arrested in 2008 shortly after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud. His death nearly a year later while awaiting trial caused an international uproar. Browder has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of a  personal vendetta over the businessman’s efforts to get other countries to impose so-called Magnitsky sanctions against Russian individuals. British foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday he had spoken to Browder and was glad he had been released.

REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin Telegram Chief Executive Pavel Durov announced the turnabout on Twitter, thanking Apple and CEO Tim Cook for getting the latest Telegram version “to millions of users, despite the recent setbacks.” On Thursday, Durov had said Apple had refused to allow updates in its App Store since April. Apple has thus far resisted a Russian order that month to remove the application from the store entirely, and the update delay sparked concern that Apple was moving to appease authorities there. Without an update, not all Telegram features worked on the latest iPhone software, and Telegram also said it was running afoul of new European data privacy laws. If the ban had become permanent, Telegram would have grown unsafe over time as security flaws were discovered but unable to be patched through the normal update process. Neither Apple nor Telegram explained the reason for the prior lack of approval or for the reversal. On Friday, Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Apple’s control over the applications in its store enables it to inspect and approve or disapprove of every new version, including updates that fix minor technical issues. If it does not approve an updated version of the software, it cannot be distributed through the App Store.  “Russia banned Telegram on its territory in April because we refused to provide decryption keys for all our users’ communications to Russia’s security agencies,” Durov said Thursday. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said it needed to guard against security threats.  After Russia’s decision to block the popular messaging service, protest rallies in Moscow against what demonstrators called internet censorship drew thousands. Telegram is challenging the block in Russian courts. Governments have stepped up pressure on technology companies to more actively police content in more forms, including applications.  In China, Apple recently banned Virtual Private Network applications and removed the New York Times from its digital marketplace. Apple has said publicly that it would notify developers when applications were removed at a government’s request, that it would limit takedowns to specific countries when possible, and that beginning in the second half of this year it would note in periodic transparency reports the number of requests for application removals.

You probably have questions.Didn‚t the E.R.A. die in the ‚80s?Technically, yes.Congress, which overwhelmingly approved the Equal Rights Amendment on March 22, 1972, set a seven-year deadline for three-quarters of the states to ratify it. The deadline was later extended to 1982 but that deadline passed with only 35 states on board. They needed 38.More about that in a moment. But first ‚¶What would the amendment do?The proposed amendment has three sections but the first is the main clause: ‚Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.‚ In 1972, supporters believed the amendment would invalidate widespread discrimination, including laws that restricted a woman‚s right to buy or sell property and employers‚ policies that denied unemployment compensation to pregnant workers. What is the origin of the E.R.A.?It started with Alice Paul, a pioneering women‚s rights activist in the United States who relentlessly fought for equal rights and helped lead the battle for women‚s suffrage. She was even forcibly fed in jail after she went on a hunger strike.After she worked to push through the 19th Amendment in 1920, which allowed women to vote, she waged a larger battle for equality for women in everything. She wrote the first draft of what became the Equal Rights Amendment.Who fought it in the ‚70s and ‚80s?Some of the most vocal opponents were women, notably Phyllis Schlafly, an influential conservative activist who warned that the amendment would backfire on women. They would be drafted by the U.S. military to fight on the front lines in wars, she said, and forced to use unisex restrooms.A poll in 1982 found that a majority of Americans supported the Equal Rights Amendment, but Ms. Schlafly‚s opposition was effective at the state level.Don‚t men and women already have equal rights?There are more protections against discrimination based on sex and gender today than there were in 1972. Many states have also approved their own versions of the E.R.A. into their constitutions.But supporters of a federal approach say that broad, inclusive protection could only come through the Equal Rights Amendment, which would cover all United States citizens against sex discrimination.What brought the E.R.A. back to life?Something unexpected happened with a different amendment in 1992.First, some history: Six months after the Constitution went into effect, James Madison offered 17 amendments to the founding document. Congress ultimately approved 12. By 1791, the states had ratified the first 10, which became known as the Bill of Rights.One of Madison‚s amendments continued to slowly work its way through the states more than 200 years after congressional approval. In May 1992, Michigan became the 38th state to ratify, making it the 27th Amendment, which says that salary increases for members of Congress do not go into effect until the term after they were approved. Supporters of the E.R.A. saw this happen and thought: Wait, why did our amendment have a deadline? Let‚s push for more states to ratify it and then see what happens.President Trump and #MeToo also helped.You probably know this part: The election of President Trump in 2016, and the defeat of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first woman nominated for president by a major party, galvanized many American women.Hundreds of thousands of women marched in protest in Washington and other cities around the world a day after he took office in 2017.Then came the revelations that coalesced into the #MeToo movement, as new reports revealed widespread accusations of sexual misconduct against powerful men like Bill O‚Reilly of Fox News and the producer Harvey Weinstein. Many ordinary and famous women said they, too, had experienced harassment, abuse and discrimination.All of this breathed new life into the Equal Rights Amendment movement. How many more states need to ratify it?In theory, just one. But perhaps not, because of the missed deadline.In 1972, supporters thought the amendment would be ratified almost overnight. The Hawaii State Legislature did so 32 minutes after Congress approved it. But it drew opposition in other places, and only 35 states in total ratified it by the 1982 deadline. (To ratify an amendment, state lawmakers must approve it within the same legislative session.)Then last year, Nevada ratified it, followed by Illinois on Wednesday.What happens if 38 states ratify the E.R.A.?Expect a legal showdown, intense lobbying and constitutional fireworks. Supporters say that the 27th Amendment shows that Congress should not have imposed a deadline on the E.R.A. Since 1992, they have argued there are several ways to make the amendment viable, which they wrapped into something called the ‚three-state strategy‚ before the votes in Nevada and Illinois.There are 13 possibilities for the final state: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.After that, the organizers would lobby Congress to recognize the 38 total ratifications.How would that work? A 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service, a policy research branch, said that Congress could simply vote to change the old deadline.It could also pass a brand-new amendment, which would most likely require states to ratify the E.R.A. again.",The Equal Rights Amendment Was Just Ratified by Illinois. What Does That Mean?,"May 31, 2018 /  6:40 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-illinois-era/illinois-passes-equal-rights-amendment-more-than-three-decades-after-deadline-idUSKCN1IW0LB,"(Reuters) - Illinois joined 36 U.S. states on Wednesday when it ratified an U.S. constitution Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) intended to ensure women are treated the same as men under state and federal laws, more than three decades after a deadline to approve it.   The state’s House of Representatives passed a resolution 72-45 to ratify the ERA amendment after the state Senate passed the measure in April. Illinois’ passage of the amendment comes at a time when  support for women’s rights is gaining momentum. In addition to the #Metoo movement, issues like equal pay in the workplace for women are at the forefront of the political and social landscape in the United States. The U.S. constitution does not currently guarantee equal rights for women, but many federal and state laws prohibit discrimination based on gender.  “By ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment we can provide a strong legal protection for women’s rights and prevent rollbacks from Congress or presidential administrations,” said State Senator Heather Steans in a statement. “This amendment is still relevant and necessary.” Illinois State Rep. Peter Breen of Lombard, who voted against the measure, told the Chicago Tribune the amendment was intended to expand taxpayer funding for abortions and to roll back abortion regulations.  The U.S. Congress approved the amendment in 1972, sending it to states for ratification. At least 38 states needed to ratify it by 1979 for it to be enacted. Congress, however, pushed the deadline to 1982 when only 35 states approved the amendment.  Nevada became the 36th state to ratify the amendment in 2017, but Virginia failed to pass it earlier this year.  Supporters argue that Congress could enact the amendment once the 38th state passes it since it has the power to “maintain the legal viability” of the amendment’s existing state ratifications, according to EqualRightsAmendment.org.  To complicate matters, five states rescinded previous ratifications. It is unclear how those retractions will play a role in the total state count.  The last change to the U.S. Constitution was made in 1992 when the 27th amendment regarding congressional compensation was ratified.

More than a month after changes to the Central American nation’s social security system triggered student-led protests, indignation at a brutal crackdown in which at least 77 people have been killed and over 800 wounded has morphed into a daily challenge to Ortega’s rule. Protesters demand he step down, while regional diplomatic body the Organization of American States said last week he should hold early elections. He has as yet shown no sign of heeding that call, which could end one of the longest standing leftist governments in Latin America, a staunch ally for socialist Venezuela. It will be not easy for the loose alliance of students, farmers, politicians and academics to dislodge Ortega, 72, who was re-elected in 2016 with nearly three-quarter of the votes after limiting opposition participation. But the Sandinista leader, whose office acknowledged a request for comment on this story but provided no immediate response, looks more isolated and fragile than at any other time in his current 11-year tenure as president. Support from the Catholic Church and the private sector is wavering. There is visible discomfort in the military, a solidly Sandinista organization constructed by Ortega’s brother from the original rebel army that overthrew a U.S.-backed dictator in the 1970s. Even though the government backpedaled on the social security measures after five days, pent-up discontent exploded. “This is a civic revolution, unprecedented in my country,” said Violeta Granera, a sociologist who ran as an opposition vice presidential candidate against Ortega in 2016. The protests, she said, were nothing less than “a national demand for a total change in the economic, political and social system.” The latest sign of fracturing came on Wednesday, when after just four days of talks, Nicaragua’s Episcopal Council of Catholic bishops suspended a “national dialogue” that had widely been seen as a chance for Ortega to take the wind out of the protests by making small concessions.  The Church had fallen behind its former adversary when he embraced Christianity before his 2007 return to office as a more moderate figure who avoided hostilities with Washington and business leaders. Yet, in a pointed assessment, Silvio Jose Baez, an auxiliary archbishop of Managua, said the government had failed to embrace the dialogue’s agenda of “democratization of the country.” On Monday, a smaller group of government, private sector and church representatives restarted talks behind closed doors.  Students and government authorities agreed in the first days of talks to a truce that quickly fell apart when groups of youths attacked protesters entrenched at the Agrarian University of Nicaragua, badly wounding at least two people. Dr. Carlos Tunnermann Bernheim, an education minister during Ortega’s first term as president in the 1980s and now a vocal critic participating in the talks, called the violence “a grave violation” of terms agreed in the talks.  Every day since, flag-bearing Nicaraguans have poured through cities and towns. Thousands took to the streets again on Saturday. At night, protesters hunker behind barricades of brick pulled up from the streets or walls of chairs and desks on university campuses, bracing with homemade mortars for clashes with pro-Ortega gangs whom witnesses and rights groups blame for many of the casualties. Demonstrators prepare to fires a homemade mortar towards the riot police during a protest against Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega's government in Managua, Nicaragua May 28, 2018.REUTERS/Oswaldo RivasPARALYSIS Daily highway blockades have snarled transportation across the country, as students and farmers erect makeshift barricades to damage the economy and wear down the government. The government estimates the turmoil has cost the economy some $250 million.  Despite the losses, many in the private sector are openly backing protesters and demanding change, turning against Ortega after an uneasy alliance in recent years that has undergirded strong economic growth. In its most explicit move yet, the Superior Council of Private Enterprise in Nicaragua, which represents the private sector, called Sunday on businesses to “join the clamor of mothers, grandmothers and wives who demand justice for the murder of their loved ones” in a march on Wednesday. “Nobody expected this violence to be the way it was and we all find it disgusting,” said Mario Arana, a former central bank chief and analyst of the private sector.  Arana said that as it dawned on business leaders that police were shooting to maim or kill, with rubber bullets aimed directly at eyes, chests, and heads, or even with live ammunition, “then things began to change for everybody.” Arana’s version of events chimes with the investigations of two local rights groups and a report from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which last Monday denounced grave violations of human rights characterized by the excessive force used by state security forces and armed third-parties during the protests.  Following the accusations that the initial police response was indiscriminate and disproportionate, agitators in civilian clothing are now behind much of the violence against protesters, observers say. Ortega has publicly lamented the violence, saying that not only opponents, but also Sandinista supporters, bystanders and police have been killed. Ortega has consolidated his rule by neutralizing and co-opting credible opposition and stalling the development of independent institutions. His wife, Rosario Murrillo, is vice president and widely seen as a power behind the throne. But the mass mobilization has allowed politicians such as Granera to forge new alliances between civic and political groups, including her own Broad Front for Democracy, she and others said. Building an effective anti-government coalition could prove difficult, however, said Eduardo Enriquez, editor of La Prensa newspaper, one of a handful of independent media outlets.  “The longer we don’t see results, people are going to start getting tired and disappointed,” he said. “And they have the force, the brute force. So we don’t want to lose the momentum.” ARMY RELUCTANCE Another base of Ortega’s support is the army. But in recent days it has signaled its refusal to appear in the streets.  Privately to business leaders and then in a statement through a spokesman, senior commanders called for dialogue and said they would not repress the population. Former officers in mid-May held a meeting in the town of Masaya, southeast of Managua, a former seat of the insurrection in the 1970s against then-strongman Anastasio Somoza and site of some of the most brutal clashes of recent weeks. Slideshow (13 Images)They spoke to a raucous gathering of protesters, beside a group painting a sidewalk tribute to the recently fallen, and a few feet from a makeshift hospital tent where volunteers treated wounded protesters who they, along with rights group and witnesses, said were denied access to government hospitals. “All of us fought the overthrow of the dictatorship of Somoza.

Built into a lush hillside, it will be a visible boost to American ties with Taiwan at a time when the number of official foreign diplomatic missions here continues to dwindle.The sprawling new facility, which sits on a 16-acre site, will give far more visibility, and aesthetic appeal, to the understated American diplomatic presence here, which is currently spread across multiple offices in Taipei. Its main office is a small, drab 1950s-era former military building hidden behind 10-foot walls.The institute, which is commonly known by its English acronym, A.I.T., is getting a face-lift at a moment when the relationship between Washington and Taipei ‚ long kept low-key to avoid angering Beijing ‚ has been elevated to levels not seen in decades. That is due in part to the administration of President Trump, who took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan‚s president, Tsai Ing-wen, after he was elected, and has since given prominent jobs to people known here as ‚friends of Taiwan,‚ including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser.In March, Mr. Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which allows more high-level visits between Taiwan and the United States. There has been speculation here that Mr. Bolton may come, which would make him one of the highest-ranking American officials to visit Taiwan since the United States withdrew diplomatic recognition in 1979.Beijing, however, has also contributed to the changed mood with its more blatant efforts to pressure Taiwan, a self-governing democracy of 23 million people that China views as a breakaway province even though it has never been under Communist rule. China, which has vowed to use force if Taiwan ever declares independence, has sent bombers around Taiwan‚s main island and a new aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, through the 100-mile-wide strait separating Taiwan from mainland China.In March, the Trump administration responded by approving the sale of submarine technology to bolster Taiwan‚s ability to defend its waters, outraging Beijing. Taiwan has stepped up efforts to make its case more forcefully in Washington, including a more active use of social media. ImageThe last high-level American official to visit Taiwan was Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 1978. After he announced the U.S. was breaking off official diplomatic ties, his car was attacked by an angry mob.CreditMarcy Nighswander/Associated PressTaiwan is trying to build on its deep historical bonds with the United States. Those go back to 1949, when America‚s World War II ally Chiang Kai-shek fled to this island after his government‚s defeat by the Communists under Mao Zedong. During the Cold War, the United States stationed troops there to protect Taiwan, and recognized Chiang‚s Republic of China as the legitimate government of China for three decades.When the United States switched diplomatic recognition to the People‚s Republic in order to get its cooperation against the Soviet Union, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act promising to give Taiwan the means to defend itself.While the United States closed its official embassy, it has maintained an unofficial presence here via the institute, which is headquartered in Virginia, not Washington. Legally described as a nonprofit organization, the institute is staffed by American diplomats who issue visas and perform most functions of a regular diplomatic mission.The institute has about 450 diplomats and local staff, roughly just under half the size of America‚s embassy in Beijing.The roots of this new visibility of United States-Taiwan ties reach into previous administrations. The lease on the institute‚s new site was signed during the administration of President George W. Bush, and most of the construction was done during the Obama administration.While the June 12 ceremony may fall on the same day as a landmark summit meeting between Mr. Trump and the leader of North Korea, it will be big news here. Ms. Tsai, Taiwan‚s president, will attend, as will Taipei‚s mayor, Ko Wen-je. The main focus of attention, however, has been on who will represent the United States, and how high-ranking that visitor will be.During a May 21 news conference to announce the ceremony, the first question from the Taiwanese journalists who filled the room was whom Washington would send. The answer by the institute‚s director, Kin Moy, an American diplomat who effectively serves as the United States‚ ambassador to Taiwan, only added to the anticipation.‚There will certainly be good friends of Taiwan coming from Washington,‚ Mr. Moy said. ‚You will recognize a number of these good friends.‚A high-level visitor would be a symbolic lift for Taiwan, which has recently taken its diplomatic lumps. In the last month, Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic both broke off relations, lured away by China. The last high-profile American official to visit Taiwan was Deputy Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher, who came in 1978 to announce the end of official diplomatic ties. An outraged mob attacked Mr. Christopher‚s limousine, pelting it with eggs, mud and rocks. He escaped with minor cuts.Regardless of who shows up, Taiwan will seek to present itself as a reliable, democratic ally and an indispensable regional partner to the United States. ‚The new compound reinforces the U.S.-Taiwan relationship at an important time,‚ said Tiffany Ma, senior director at BowerGroupAsia, a Washington-based government affairs consultancy that has extensive dealings with Taiwan.‚As Taiwan faces increasing pressures from China‚s military coercion, influence campaigns, and efforts to undermine Taiwan‚s international space, the compound sends a crucial message that the United States remains very much vested in Taiwan,‚ she said.The compound may also present its own challenges to Washington‚s diplomatic balancing act between Taiwan and China.The American presence is already being felt in Neihu, the neighborhood that will host the new institute.American contractors in baseball caps and overalls congregate on the stoop of the 7-Eleven convenience store a few doors down for post-work beers.Property prices have also gone up, and a new police station has opened across from the compound. Down the street, Chen Feng-yu, the manager of Parsley Bistro, said he expected his restaurant to benefit from crowds of Taiwanese visa applicants. A half million Taiwanese visit the United States annually.Describing United States-Taiwan relations as ‚simple yet complicated,‚ Mr. Chen said the move would be good for Taiwan‚s confidence, not only in its relationship with the United States but also vis-√†-vis China.‚Of course, the U.S. is a good friend to Taiwan,‚ he said. As for China‚s increasingly aggressive approach toward Taiwan, he said, ‚if they‚re enjoying it, then good for them.‚",Don‚Äôt Call It an Embassy: U.S. Gives Its Taiwan Ties a $250 Million Upgrade,"June 11, 2018 /  11:16 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-diplomacy/u-s-shows-new-de-facto-embassy-in-taiwan-amid-china-tensions-idUSKBN1J72QS,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - The United States unveiled a new $256 million representative office in Taiwan’s capital on Tuesday, a de facto embassy that underscores Washington’s strategic ties with the democratic, self-ruled island as it faces escalating tensions with China. Washington cut diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979 but remains the island’s strongest ally and sole foreign arms supplier. It opened the American Institute of Taiwan (AIT) to conduct relations between the two sides after severing ties.   In comments certain to rile Beijing, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said the new complex was a reaffirmation of both sides commitment to a “vital relationship”. “The friendship between Taiwan and the U.S. has never been more promising. The great story of Taiwan-U.S. relations remains to be filled with the efforts of those that will one day occupy this building,” Tsai said. So long as both sides stood together, nothing could come between them, she added. The new complex, a major upgrade from the low-key military building the AIT had used for decades, will serve as the representative office later this summer, said AIT Director Kin Moy. Related CoverageChina complains to U.S. about new de facto embassy in TaiwanMarie Royce, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs, said at a ceremony to mark the unveiling that the complex was a symbol of the strength and vibrancy of the U.S.-Taiwan partnership.  “We have faced many trials along this journey, but we have risen to the challenge at every turn, knowing that our shared commitment to democracy would see us through,” said Royce, the highest-ranking State Department official to visit Taiwan since 2015. In Beijing, China’s Foreign Ministry said they had lodged “stern representations” with Washington about the new building and the visit of the senior U.S. diplomat. “We urge the United States to scrupulously abide by its promises to China over the Taiwan issue, correct their wrong actions, and avoid damaging China-US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing.

REUTERS/Tyrone SiuThe sprawling new site occupies 6.5 hectares, including Chinese gardens, in Taipei’s Neihu district. AIT’s Taipei office has nearly 500 American and local employees, while its Kaohsiung branch has more than 30 staff. The ceremony was attended by high-ranking Taiwan officials and senior business executives, including Morris Chang, the former chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world’s biggest contract chip maker.    China claims self-ruled Taiwan under its “one China” policy and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring what it sees as a wayward province under its control. China’s hostility towards Taiwan has grown since President Tsai was elected in 2016. Beijing suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing. The Global Times, a widely-read Chinese state-run newspaper, said China should warn Taiwan and the United States against any provocation. “The mainland must continue to build up its deterrence against Taiwanese authorities, making them know that the U.S. cannot be their savior,” it said in an editorial on the opening of the new office.

An exhausted Rohingya refugee woman touches the shore after crossing the Bangladesh-Myanmar border by boat through the Bay of Bengal, in Shah Porir Dwip, Bangladesh September 11, 2017. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui   The signing of a memorandum of understanding between the government and U.N. development and refugee agencies - the UNDP and the UNHCR - marks a warming of ties which hit a low point last year after the government suggested some agencies provided food to Rohingya militants. The head of the United Nations in Myanmar, Knut Ostby, said he hoped U.N. staff would be able to travel to the violence-ravaged north of Rakhine State “almost immediately” to assess the situation and - over time - to help the refugees in Bangladesh make an informed decision about potential returns. Since August, about 700,000 Rohingya have fled an army crackdown in Myanmar, many reporting killings, rape and arson on a large scale. The United Nations has called the campaign a textbook example of “ethnic cleansing” - a charge Myanmar denies. U.N. officials have said for months the conditions in Myanmar were “not conducive” to returns which would be safe, voluntary and dignified and view Wednesday’s deal as a first step toward meeting those objectives. “There are two really crucial things that need to be in place - one is to have an identity for the people who come back, so that they can live as normal members of society both in terms of an identity and in terms of being able to have the freedom of movement,” Ostby told Reuters by phone. “And the other issue is that they need to be able to live in safety. They should not have to risk further violence,” said Ostby, who serves as the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar.  Access to basic services, livelihoods and infrastructure would also have to be addressed, he said. Rohingya are widely called “Bengali” in Buddhist-majority Myanmar - which they see as a derogatory term implying they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They have been denied citizenship despite many tracing their roots in the country back generations. ‘PATH TO CITIZENSHIP’ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi’s government has pressed the Rohingya to accept National Verification Cards - documents that are a part of government effort to register Rohingya, but which falls short of offering them citizenship. Rohingya community leaders have widely rejected the card, saying it treats life-long residents like new immigrants. Ostby, asked how the Wednesday agreement might help to resolve the issue of citizenship, said: “We have been talking for a long time about making a clear and predictable path to citizenship for those who are eligible.” But the granting of citizenship was the government’s prerogative, he said. “What we can do is to facilitate and we call for commitment to international principles,” said Ostby in his first detailed remarks on the text of the agreement, which has not been made public. Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete the voluntary repatriation of the refugees within two years but differences between them persist, impeding implementation of the plan. The Myanmar government said in a statement after the signing it hoped the repatriation process would “hasten” with U.N. involvement. It said the UNHCR would help “in the implementation of the voluntary repatriation and the reintegration of all those who return”, while the UNDP would focus on preparing “conditions for recovery and resilience-based development”.

Since August 2017, about 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled a military crackdown in mainly Buddhist Myanmar, many reporting killings, rape and arson on a large scale, U.N. and other aid organizations have said. “Since the conditions are not conducive for voluntary return yet, the MoU (memorandum of understanding) is the first and necessary step to support the government’s efforts to change that situation,” the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement.  Myanmar’s government said in a brief statement late on Thursday the MoU would be signed “soon” and U.N. agencies would “support access to livelihoods through the design and implementation of community-based interventions”.  Myanmar civilian government spokesman Zaw Htay said he had nothing to add to the statement.  Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete the voluntary repatriation of the refugees within two years but differences between the two sides persist, impeding implementation of the plan.    In a separate statement on Thursday, Myanmar’s government said it would set up an independent commission to investigate “the violation of human rights and related issues” in Rakhine State following the army operation there in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security posts.  The commission will be assisted by international experts, the statement said without elaborating. In the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, senior UNHCR official George William Okoth-Obbo told reporters after a five-day visit to Rohingya refugee camps along the border that conditions in Myanmar did not yet allow a “safe and sustainable return”. Okoth-Obbo said an immediate challenge for humanitarian agencies was to relocate 200,000 Rohingya refugees threatened by seasonal monsoon flooding and landslides to a safer place. The United Nations and aid agencies have described the crackdown on the Rohingya as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”, an accusation Myanmar rejects.  The Security Council asked Myanmar in November to ensure no “further excessive use of military force” and to allow “freedom of movement, equal access to basic services, and equal access to full citizenship for all”. Myanmar has for years denied Rohingya citizenship, freedom of movement and access to basic services such as healthcare. Many in Myanmar regard the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from mostly Muslim Bangladesh.

The court ordered Lithuania to pay Abu Zubaydah, also known as Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, about $152,000 in damages and costs. It also ordered Romania to pay about $118,000 to Mr. Nashiri. But it is not clear whether or how those funds will be paid; the same court delivered a similar ruling against Poland on behalf of the two men in 2015, but a lawyer for Abu Zubaydah said on Thursday that Poland had not paid the roughly $262,000 in court-ordered reparations from that ruling.The cases shed light on the murky and once-hidden world of the C.I.A.‚s rendition, detention and interrogation program. The agency shuttled captives suspected of major terrorist acts between secret overseas prisons called black sites and tortured them with tactics like waterboarding, prolonged sleep deprivation, forced nudity, confinement in cramped boxes and shackling into painful stress positions.The court‚s findings came at a moment of renewed attention to the torture program because of President Trump‚s appointment of Gina Haspel as the new director of the C.I.A.In late 2002, Ms. Haspel oversaw a secret facility in Thailand where Mr. Nashiri was subjected to waterboarding and other tactics. In 2005, as the chief of staff to the head of the agency‚s Counterterrorism Center, she was also involved in the agency‚s destruction of videotapes of interrogation sessions.ImageAbd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was seized in Dubai in October 2002 and had been held in Romania between 2004 and 2005, the court said.CreditABC, via Associated PressDuring her confirmation hearing in mid-May, Ms. Haspel vowed never to restart such a detention and interrogation program, even if Mr. Trump ordered her to do so. She also said that in hindsight, the C.I.A. should not have undertaken the program, saying it ‚did damage to our officers and our standing in the world.‚ During the Bush administration, the Justice Department issued secret memos blessing the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques as lawful despite anti-torture laws. The C.I.A.‚s inspector general and the Senate Intelligence Committee later found that the agency inflicted more severe abuses on captives than it had told the Justice Department or its overseers. The department declined to prosecute anyone for his or her involvement in the program.In a statement after the rulings, Amrit Singh, a lead lawyer for the matter for the Open Society Justice Initiative, which filed a complaint with the court on behalf of Mr. Nashiri, said that the justice system‚s acknowledgment of what happened was important.‚The European court‚s ruling is critical for upholding standards of international law ‚ including that torture is absolutely prohibited,‚ she said. ‚It stands in stark contrast to the United States‚ decision to promote Gina Haspel to C.I.A. director despite her role in my client‚s torture.‚The C.I.A. declined to comment.Abu Zubaydah was captured in Pakistan in March 2002, and later held in Thailand, Poland and Lithuania. He was initially considered a Qaeda leader involved in planning terrorist attacks. But the Senate Intelligence Committee report found that C.I.A. records did not support those claims, and the agency later concluded that while he was involved in jihadist training camps, he was not a member of Al Qaeda.Mr. Nashiri was captured in Dubai in October 2002 and was held in Romania between 2004 and 2005, the court said. He is accused of helping orchestrate an attack in 2000 on a United States Navy destroyer, the Cole, in the harbor of the Yemeni port of Aden, which killed 17 sailors, and an attack on a French oil tanker, the Limburg, in 2002.On Thursday, in separate rulings issued simultaneously, the court said that Lithuania and Romania knew enough that hosting the C.I.A. prisons ‚ and failing to adequately investigate what happened inside them ‚ violated their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The court said it had been permitted no access to either man, and described their treatment based on documents like a Senate Intelligence Committee report about the program, as well as accounts the two men provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross in 2006 and to an American military tribunal after their transfer to Guant√°namo.Although the locations of the black-site prisons have been widely reported, the United States government continues to treat them as classified secrets. The European court, sitting as a panel of seven judges, concluded that the prison where Mr. Zubaydah was held in Lithuania was the one identified in the Senate report under the code name Violet, and the prison in Romania where Mr. Nashiri was held was identified as Black.Lithuania did not immediately respond publicly to the court‚s findings. The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was studying the ruling and that it was ‚firmly attached to the principle of respect for human rights,‚ including that the prohibition on torture must be obeyed ‚even under the most difficult of circumstances.‚","Lithuania and Romania Complicit in C.I.A.

A view shows the courtroom of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Vincent KesslerWashington’s so-called rendition program is still shrouded in secrecy, around a decade after it ended. Washington has acknowledged it held al Qaeda suspects in jails outside U.S. jurisdiction, but it has not provided a full list of locations. The ECHR ruled four years ago that the CIA ran a secret jail in Poland. It has since been holding hearings about similar sites in Romania and Lithuania, neither of which has publicly acknowledged letting the U.S. agency hold prisoners on its soil. The Strasburg-based court said Lithuania hosted a CIA jail between February 2005 and March 2006 and Romania between September 2003 and November 2005. Both contravened the European Human Rights Convention which prohibits torture, illegal detention and the death penalty. In its ruling, the ECHR said a stateless Palestinian, Zayn Al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, had been held in Lithuania and that authorities there “had known the CIA would subject him to treatment contrary to the Convention”. “Lithuania had also permitted him to be moved to another CIA detention site in Afghanistan, exposing him to further ill-treatment,” it said.    The court said Romania had similarly violated the Convention in the case of a Saudi national, Abd Al Rahim Husseyn Muhammad Al Nashiri, who is facing the death penalty in the United States in charges over his alleged role in terrorist attacks. It said Lithuania and Romania should launch full investigations into their roles in the rendition program and punish any officials responsible. The cases were filed on behalf of detainees currently held by the United States in Guantanamo Bay. Lithuanian prime minister Saulius Skvernelis told reporters his government would consider whether to appeal the ruling. A parliamentary investigation in 2010 stated that Lithuania’s security service helped the CIA establish a detention facility, though it said there was no proof the facility was used to hold prisoners. Prosecutors reopened their investigation into the allegations in 2015. In 2015, Romania’s foreign ministry said authorities had no evidence showing there were CIA detention centers in the country. However, Ioan Talpes, a former national security adviser to Romania’s president, testified that Romania had allowed U.S. intelligence to operate a facility in Romania, though officials were unaware people were detained there. The CIA’s role in the detention and torture of prisoners in the years after the September 11, 2001 attacks was again in the headlines last month when it became the focus of confirmation hearings for the agency’s new director, Gina Haspel.

Some of the activists have been released, but others remain detained. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced last September that the notoriously conservative nation was lifting the ban on female drivers as part of a reform effort. Saudi women have long been restricted in most aspects of public life, from what they can wear to where they can travel, in part because of the country‚s strict guardianship laws.On June 24, Saudi women will legally be able to drive for the first time. But critics say the Vogue coverage fails to highlight some Saudi women whose activism helped draw international attention to the issue, and who now face persecution.The issue does feature Manal al-Sharif, one of the Saudi activists who took part in the 2011 protests against the restrictions and was later arrested for the action, but does not mention the latest arrests.Twitter users were swift in their reaction, calling out Vogue Arabia for what some saw as an oversight. Others photoshopped faces of two detained women‚s rights activists, Aziza al-Yousef and Loujain Hathloul, over the face of Princess Hayfa. Both women are still being held by Saudi authorities, according to Human Rights Watch.   Others voiced support for Vogue Arabia, including Ms. Sharif, the activist featured in it. She said she was happy that her ‚country women are being celebrated‚ ‚ but also urged readers not to forget the detained activists. Vogue Arabia launched in November 2016, with a staff of 25 and its headquarters in Dubai.One of a series of pushes into new and potentially lucrative foreign markets by the magazine publisher Cond√© Nast, the new title was pitched as a digital-first, bilingual effort to attract the hearts, minds and money of women in the 22 countries of the Arab League. Saudi Arabia makes up most of the readership, Vogue Arabia said. After just two published print editions, the editor in chief, a Saudi princess named Deena Aljuhani Abdulaziz, was abruptly replaced by a male Cond√© Nast veteran, Manuel Arnaut. And last year, there was an outcry on social media after the models Gigi and Bella Hadid were selected as cover stars for two issues ‚ Gigi in March and Bella in the inaugural September issue (the most important of the annual calendar) ‚ rather than celebrities from the Arab world.With content ranging from profiles on modest fashion designers to articles on how to style your hair under a hijab, and news articles on local events such as Saudi Arabia‚s first fashion week, Vogue Arabia has made efforts to connect and promote the burgeoning Muslim fashion scene, as well as that of the West.Glossy magazines in North America and Europe have long blended fashion and lifestyle content with broader conversations on politics and social issues. Vogue Arabia‚s June issue was its first step into such waters.In Princess Hayfa‚s interview with Mr. Arnaut, she glosses over the dueling narratives in the country, and steers clear of anything that could be perceived as critical of the government. Her father ruled the country from 2005 until his death in 2015.‚In our country, there are some conservatives who fear change,‚ she told the magazine. ‚For many, it‚s all they have known. Personally, I support these changes with great enthusiasm.‚Members of the princess‚s own family have been singled out by the crown prince, who is her cousin.A number of her father‚s 14 sons were detained last year in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton in what the government called an anti-corruption campaign. Critics dismissed the move as a money grab, and associates of King Abdullah‚s children say the government is trying to take wealth that they consider their inheritance. One of Princess Hayfa‚s brothers, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, is still detained. The Saudi authorities have never explained why. In his editor‚s letter, Mr. Arnaut applauded ‚exciting and progressive changes transforming the kingdom and, by ripple effect, our region,‚ but made no mention of the driving activists.In an emailed statement, he said, ‚Informing and initiating healthy debates around meaningful topics are a priority for us, and we therefore decided to emphasize this with an iconic and powerful image that is completely fulfilling its purpose: bring focus to the region and to the role of women in Saudi society.‚Mr. Arnaut said the publication had seen an ‚outpouring of positive sentiment‚ from the region.‚Overall, I firmly believe we fulfilled our mission: Saudi Arabia, its women, and its issues are being widely debated by the world,‚ he said. ‚It is an incredible moment for the region ‚ of drastic changes and adjustments ‚ and I‚m proud that Vogue Arabia is an active voice in this debate.‚International human rights groups have criticized Saudi Arabia‚s decision to detain the activists and are demanding their release. Human Rights Watch criticized Crown Prince Mohammed‚s conflicting messaging on female drivers.‚Saudi authorities appear to be punishing these women‚s rights champions for promoting a goal bin Salman alleges to support ‚ ending discrimination against women,‚ Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.The United Nations has called the decision to imprison the activists ‚perplexing.‚‚Given the significant loosening of certain restrictions on women‚s activities in Saudi Arabia in recent months, including the forthcoming ending of the ban on women driving, it‚s perplexing why both women and men engaged in campaigning for such positive developments are now being targeted by the authorities,‚ Elizabeth Throssell, spokeswoman for the United Nations human rights office, said at a news conference in Geneva earlier this week.","Vogue Arabia Hails Saudi Reform, Ignoring Jailed Activists","June 1, 2018 /  1:31 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-driving-women/saudi-princess-vogue-cover-sparks-anger-over-jailed-activists-idUSKCN1IX4UW,"BEIRUT (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An image on the cover of Vogue Arabia of a Saudi princess behind the wheel of a red convertible has sparked anger in the conservative kingdom following the jailing of activists who campaigned for women to be allowed to drive. Nearly a dozen prominent activists were arrested last month, just weeks before the ban on women driving is due to be lifted. Most were women who had for years campaigned for the reforms now being implemented. Supporters of the activists took to social media to accuse the publishers of Vogue Arabia of insensitivity over the cover image of Princess Hayfa bint Abdullah al-Saud. “Tell @VogueArabia that when it falsely presents royal princesses as champions of #SaudiWomenDriving, real women champions are at imminent risk,” tweeted Fadi Al-Qadi, whose handle describes him as a human rights commentator.    “A princess on the cover of Vogue Arabia to celebrate lifting the ban while the women driving activists are in jail for treason,” tweeted another user under the handle @Hala_Aldosari.     Some Twitter users shared doctored versions of the cover photo swapping the face of Princess Hayfa with that of Loujain al-Hathloul, one of the detained activists.     The decision to lift a decades-old ban on women driving cars was hailed as proof of a new progressive trend in Saudi Arabia. But activists’ arrests have raised concerns from campaigners and the United Nations over Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s approach to reforms.

After graduating from Stanford University in 2005, she worked at a consulting firm and a venture capital firm before attending Harvard Business School. With her M.B.A. in hand, she moved to San Francisco and founded a technology company, Stitch Fix, in 2011. Stitch Fix has upended the traditional shopping experience. Customers fill out an online survey about their likes and dislikes, then a company stylist assembles a box of clothing and sends it out. Customers keep what they want for a fee, and return what they don‚t want for free. The company grew fast, and last year, Ms. Lake took Stitch Fix public. Though Stitch Fix priced its shares below the expected range, the stock is trading above its offering price, and the company is now valued at nearly $2 billion. Ms. Lake remains chief executive, making her one of the most prominent female executives in Silicon Valley. Yet Ms. Lake has faced adversity along the way. She says she was constantly underestimated by investors, and has been publicly associated with an instance of sexual harassment allegedly committed by Justin Caldbeck, a prominent venture capitalist whose previous firm, Lightspeed Venture Partners, invested in Stitch Fix. (The firm and Ms. Lake signed a mutual nondisparagement agreement in 2013, and Ms. Lake has not spoken about the episode publicly.) This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in the Stitch Fix offices in San Francisco. So you grew up in San Francisco? I did. One of the very few. They say there are more dogs in the city than children under 18, which is a crazy statistic. The city has changed a lot in the time that I‚ve lived here. My dad is a doctor in the public university system. He‚s had, I think, exactly two employers in his whole life. And my mom is a public-school teacher.What was your first job? It was either Banana Republic or a smoothie shop. Or it would have been lifeguarding. I don‚t know, actually. At Banana Republic, I learned that so much of your work experience is enjoying the people you work with. Optimizing for who you're around is important. What did you think you were going to be growing up?I thought I would be a doctor, and I even took the MCAT. But I didn‚t really imagine myself going to work 9 to 5, or 7 to 7, whatever you do in a hospital. I kind of just delayed that journey, and I got a job in consulting. Then I worked at a venture fund for two years, and I went to Harvard Business School from there.What was the venture fund like? It was so boring. To be clear, I was not a venture investor. I was a venture note taker, memo creator, analyst. But I got to meet hundreds of entrepreneurs, and I got the entrepreneur bug. You have these ideas in your head of what an entrepreneur looks like ‚ Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates, these child geniuses who dropped out of school. But then I met hundreds of entrepreneurs that are all just totally unqualified, totally normal people. That inspired me.  So I took advantage of having a V.C. signature. I could meet with entrepreneurs and get to know what the space was like, learn about innovation in retail. But the job itself was just boring.How did you get the idea for Stitch Fix? When I worked in consulting, I had all these ideas where people just thought I had five heads. This was one of those, and it was one that was super easy to test and had this inherent attraction from people that I would talk to about it. What we are is a personal styling thing, which happens to arrive in a box. It‚s just like getting a fitting room delivered to your home. It was one of these ideas that 100 percent of people that I talked to were like: ‚That sounds amazing. I would love to do that.‚ How did the business scale? We first launched the company in April 2011. I had 29 clients that were mostly my friends, and then that became 35. Then we added 35 more the next month, and then we added 110 more the next month, and then like the two months after that we were adding 200 or 300 a month. We didn‚t even have a website and hundreds of people were wanting to try it. That was just a real moment of validation. If these strangers are sending me $20 on PayPal to get a shipment of clothes sent to them, there‚s something here.I tried Stitch Fix for a while. I got three boxes, and walked away with one pair of jeans and two pairs of socks.That‚s not super successful. Give us another shot.‚My friends‚ moms have told me just horrible things about what their work environments were like, and it‚s made me really grateful and thankful to be living in this day and age.‚‚ Katrina Lake, chief executive of Stitch Fix Do you worry about this being a fad?We have enough data to be able to know that there is a percentage of people for whom we are the primary way that they‚re shopping. I think there's still a lot more opportunity.Do you like being a public company, or is it a pain?So far, it‚s made us better. Every year, regardless of being public or not, my job has been different than the year before. So I think I‚ve been in the habit of needing to rehire myself in this job, in this role with these responsibilities. And this year is definitely different than in years past. We‚ve always balanced profitability with growth. Now that's a commitment that we‚ve made to the public market. That‚s really interesting to say that your job has been different every single year. What are you doing now that you didn‚t a year ago? The first year, my job was every single Monday we shipped fixes. We all got in an assembly line, and everybody's wearing sweatpants, taping boxes shut. Our printer would break and we'd need to print labels, and I‚d go run to Office Depot and buy a new printer. It was just absurd what that job was like. In the last few years, my job has evolved to be a lot more about the people around, just making sure that we have the best leaders and helping us to fulfill our potential. This year, the addition of new public shareholders in addition to our private shareholders has been just a different dynamic. There‚s so much waste in fashion today. How do you try to not just make that problem even worse by buying so many clothes and sending them out? There are all kinds of reasons that we want to avoid it. It‚s wasteful, it‚s wasting resources, it‚s wasting money. Our model inherently is a model that focuses on how to reduce it. And we‚ve done a lot of in-kind donations. If we have end-of-season product or product that we‚re not moving, we have some great partnerships in place, so that we can feel like it‚s going to a good home, even if it‚s not kind of a paying client‚s home. That‚s definitely in stark contrast to high fashion. There, they literally burn the stuff. A reader, Lulu Patterson, asks via email: ‚What is it like being a woman in such a male-dominated industry, and how has the uprising of female voices bringing to light the sexism and harassment in Silicon Valley changed the way you lead your company and navigate the tech world?‚One of the biggest challenges standing in the way of diversity and equal opportunity for people is the way that people build founding teams. People tend to bring on my buddy from this thing and then my buddy from that thing, and it‚s like, ‚You‚re just kind of bringing the same people that you‚ve worked with back together, getting the gang together again to found another company.‚ That just creates this circle of capital raising that I think is not healthy, and I don‚t think people are looking at the whole world and saying, ‚Who are the best people for these jobs?‚In our case, it was really hard to raise money. So we built a company that‚s doing $1 billion in revenue with $42 million of capital. Meanwhile, there are lots of mostly male C.E.O.s out there who have raised billions and billions of dollars.You‚ve been publicly associated with an instance of sexual harassment by a prominent venture capitalist. How has that changed the way you run the company? Even though my journey was hard, there are many, many, many women before me for whom the journey was harder, if not made impossible. My friends‚ moms have told me just horrible things about what their work environments were like, and it‚s made me really grateful and thankful to be living in this day and age. Even though it could use some improvement, it‚s better than it was before.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testifies before a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the “Defense Department budget posture in review of the Defense Authorization Request for FY2019 and the Future Years Defense Program” on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein Reuters first reported that two U.S. Navy warships sailed near South China Sea islands claimed by China on Sunday, even as President Donald Trump seeks Chinese cooperation on North Korea. The operation, known as “freedom of navigation,” was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate. China expressed its anger, saying it had sent ships and aircraft to warn the U.S. warships to leave. “You’ll notice there is only one country that seems to take active steps to rebuff them or state their resentment (to) them, but it’s international waters and a lot of nations want to see freedom of navigation,” Mattis told reporters while enroute to Hawaii, where he will oversee a change of command for U.S. Pacific Command.  While the Sunday operation had been planned months in advance, and similar operations have become routine, it comes at a particularly sensitive time and just days after the Pentagon disinvited China from a major U.S.-hosted naval drill. Critics have said these operations have little impact on Chinese behavior and are largely symbolic. Pentagon officials have long complained that China has not been candid enough about its rapid military build-up and using South China Sea islands to gather intelligence. Recent satellite photographs showed China appeared to have deployed truck-mounted surface-to-air missiles or anti-ship cruise missiles at Woody Island. Earlier this month, China’s air force landed bombers on disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the region.[L3N1SR08Q] “When they (Chinese) do things that are opaque to the rest of us, then we cannot cooperate in areas that we would otherwise cooperate in,” Mattis said. Mattis said U.S. diplomats were engaged on the issue and he had heard concerns about Chinese actions not just from within the United States government, but also from regional allies.  He will have strong words for China when he travels to  Singapore for the Shangri-la dialogue, a security forum, later this week.  China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein Mattis said on Tuesday the United States would push back against what it sees as China’s militarization of islands in the South China Sea despite China’s condemnation of a voyage through the region on the weekend by two U.S. Navy ships. “The United States military presence in the South China Sea is greater than that of China and other countries that surround the seas combined,” Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular briefing. Hua also questioned whether U.S. Navy “freedom of navigation” operations were really about preserving the right for ships to sail through the region or an attempt to maintain hegemony. “This sounds like a case of a thief crying ‘stop thief’ to cover their misdeeds,” she said. Speaking at a separate briefing, defense ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said they had noted that the United States had recently been “turning a blind eye to the facts and hyping up” the militarization of the South China Sea. No country has the right to “make irresponsible remarks” about China’s building of necessary defense facilities on its own territory, Ren said. However, he said the United Sides had formally proposed Mattis visit China, and both countries were coordinating on details. He did not provide a date for a possible trip. The Global Times, a state-backed Chinese tabloid that does not reflect official policy, said in an editorial on Thursday that China must prepare to forcefully respond to any “extreme” U.S. interference in the South China Sea. “Aside from deploying defensive weapons on the Spratly Islands, China should build a powerful deterrence system, including an aerial base and a roving naval force and base,” the paper said.

There was the volunteer who contracted leptospirosis, a bacterial infection often caused by contact with rat urine, while cleaning.‚When the government said only 64 people died, I knew it wasn‚t true because I had many friends that lost a loved one after the storm,‚ Ms. Sanchez said.Days after a new study from researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health estimated that the death toll from Hurricane Maria may be as high as 4,645 people, mainly because of delayed medical care, hundreds of protesters gathered on Saturday in the shadow of the United Nations to demand that the international organization audit the number of casualties. The Puerto Rican government is reviewing its official death toll from the storm, which it said in December was 64. ‚If it were 5,000 kittens, there would be outrage,‚ said Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of Uprose, a Latino organization in Brooklyn. ‚If it was 5,000 dogs, there would be outrage. If it was 5,000 blonde-haired, blue-eyed women, there would be outrage.‚[64? 1,052? 4,645? We explain the conflicting estimates of Hurricane Maria deaths.]The protest was organized by the Collective Action for Puerto Rico, a coalition of faith-based and labor organizations. Protesters held signs saying ‚Puerto Rican lives matter‚ and ‚If you are not angry you are not paying attention.‚They took off their shoes as a symbol of the people who died as a result of the storm but who were not immediately counted, and called for more attention to be paid to the hurricane‚s aftermath in the form of more assistance for people still struggling on the island as hurricane season begins. ‚Sisters and brothers in this country forget that the people of Puerto Rico are our fellow Americans,‚ said Linda Sarsour, who was one of the lead organizers of the Women‚s March in Washington. ‚They deserve to be treated just like any American in any part of this country.‚United Nations officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Researchers behind the study, which was published on Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, visited close to 3,300 randomly selected households across Puerto Rico. They found that 38 people from those households died in the months after the storm. Using their independent estimate of the number of deaths, researchers calculated the mortality rate after the hurricane and compared it with mortality rates from 2016. Researchers found a 62 percent increase in the mortality rate from Sept. 20, 2017, when the hurricane hit, through Dec. 31, 2017, compared with the same time period in 2016.The study found that the official death toll of 64 was a ‚substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria,‚ and that the estimated 4,645-person death toll could exceed 5,000.Puerto Rican officials said in December that they planned to revise the official death toll, counting direct and indirect storm deaths. The commonwealth commissioned a study on Hurricane Maria deaths from the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, which is expected to release the first part of its review this summer.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributes deaths to a hurricane such as Maria if they are caused by flying debris or unhealthy conditions that can result in ‚injury, illness or loss of necessary medical services.‚ The Harvard study found that interruptions in medical care were the primary cause for the high mortality rates in the months after the storm. At the protest in New York, Mili Bonilla held a smiling picture of her 85-year-old father, Jose (Pepe) Bonilla, with whom she would have regular phone conversations as he went to the supermarket or for a walk. After Hurricane Maria, Mr. Bonilla, who lived in Toa Baja, P.R., began having trouble breathing. He was taken to a hospital, which ran out of oxygen. At another hospital, the generator providing electricity for his ventilator would shut off occasionally. The official cause of death on his death certificate was sepsis.‚In reality, his death was indirectly caused by the hurricane,‚ Ms. Bonilla said. ‚The hospitals were not running as usual. These stories cannot be forgotten.‚Having an accurate death toll after a natural diaster helps determine the scope of the recovery effort, encouraging new resiliency efforts, while providing families closure and qualifying them for assistance, the Harvard researchers said in explaining their efforts.Jordan Sanchez, who works with the disaster relief agency SBP, said he was worried about the future because Puerto Rico is still struggling with basic tasks at the start of hurricane season, which began on Friday.Mr. Sanchez, who is Puerto Rican and has family members on the island, recently returned from his second trip there since the storm. He said families, especially in more rural areas, are still struggling to obtain power, healthy food and medical care. Normally, the aid relief effort would have already moved to the recovery and rebuilding phase.‚Even a strong storm could be devastating,‚ Mr. Sanchez said. ‚But we are a resilient people, so I have to remain optimistic.‚",Protesters Demand Audit of Hurricane Maria Death Toll in Puerto Rico,"June 14, 2018 /  11:08 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-hurricane-elderly/in-puerto-rico-a-new-hurricane-season-threatens-the-elderly-idUSKBN1JA1DU,"ADJUNTAS, PUERTO RICO (Reuters) - At 84 years old and battling cancer, Israel Gonzalez Maldonado has lived without electricity for the nine months since Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico.

With another hurricane season starting, older Puerto Ricans have little to protect them from another storm on an impoverished island that remains far from fully recovered. Younger and wealthier people have been moving away for years, leaving an older and sicker population in the hands of an underfunded healthcare system. Tens of thousands more have fled since Maria. “We wish we could move, at least for the time he has left,” Reyes said of her husband. Senior citizens make up a larger share of the population here than in all but four U.S. states, according to federal Census data. About half are disabled, more than any state. Forty percent of seniors rely on food stamps, more than three times the percentage in New York state, the second-highest nationally. (For a graphic on Puerto Rico's aging population, see: tmsnrt.rs/2L9N6M0 ) Yet the island has just six nursing homes - with a total of 159 beds - that are certified by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) to provide rehabilitative services. Puerto Rico relies instead on a patchwork of about 800 nursing homes licensed by the island’s Department of Family. They are typically private businesses or nonprofit organizations that care for small numbers of elderly people with limited services - and limited budgets, strained further since Maria. A fragile healthcare system is hardly the only problem that leaves the elderly here - and all Puerto Ricans - vulnerable to another catastrophic storm. About 7,000 houses and businesses still lack power, after Maria leveled a grid that was ill-maintained before the storm. Power utility PREPA has patched together most of the system but remains years away from making the fundamental improvements needed to enable it to withstand another hurricane. “The grid needs to be rebuilt - not just the lines,” PREPA Chief Executive Walter Higgins said.

REUTERS/Alvin BaezMaria also damaged nearly half the island’s levees. Several major water pumps, used to remove floodwater, remain in disrepair.  “God help us, but we definitely can’t handle any more hurricanes,” said Tania Vazquez, the island’s secretary of natural resources.  Governor Ricardo Rossello’s office declined to comment on the island’s hurricane preparedness or on specific efforts to protect the elderly, referring questions to other agencies. Glorimar Andujar, Secretary of the Department of Family, said officials learned a lot from Maria about how to prepare for the next storm. “The emergency plans are much better,” Andujar said, “because we now have an experience that no other generation of agency leaders have experienced.” ELDERLY AT RISK Rosa Iturrizaga runs Hostal de Amigos, a small eldercare residence in San Juan. The home barely broke even before Maria, relying on resident fees of between $2,000 and $3,000 a month. Since then, two of 11 residents moved to the mainland, and insurance has so far not paid for about $40,000 in storm damage, Iturrizaga said. The business carries $500,000 in debt, has fallen behind on loan and tax payments and now loses up to $5,000 a month. “I don’t know what’s kept me going,” Iturrizaga said. “I love doing this, but I’m looking at other things to do with the land.” Another private home, the nonprofit Asilo San Rafael in Arecibo, theoretically charges residents $1,200 a month; in reality, only three of 27 residents pay full price, and at least nine pay nothing, said board member Lucila Oliver. Slideshow (18 Images)Operating costs run about $700,000 annually, with about $110,000 coming from a handful of subsidies from the island’s central government – subsidies she says have declined sharply in recent years as the now-bankrupt Puerto Rican government fell into a fiscal crisis, Oliver said. The Department of Family’s Andujar disputed that the subsidies have declined, but Oliver provided Reuters with balance sheets showing a drop in department funding to $59,000 this fiscal year from $80,000 last year. Maria brought new costs: about $1,200 a month to bring in water tanks, and thousands more on diesel for generators. Oliver said San Rafael is “used to living on the edge,” but says the edge has drawn closer since the hurricanes. Many elderly and disabled here find a way to get by at home, with little care. Some seek help from the Department of Family, applying for a caregiver to come by just a day or two a week, said Andujar. Many are turned away, she said. “The funding is very limited,” she said, “and the need is very big.” PREPARING FOR ANOTHER HIT This hurricane season, the department is making sure it has accurate locations for all licensed nursing homes after cell phone service disruptions stymied the response to Hurricane Maria. The homes, Andujar said, are now required to have 30 days of food on hand, and the department has also requested they have generators and water tanks. She added that about 315,000 elderly people currently receive benefits as part of a $1.27 billion federal allocation under the Nutritional Assistance Program. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) remains on the island and said it has given municipalities money to improve community resilience. Dr. Carmen Sanchez Salgado, Puerto Rico’s ombudsmen for the elderly, said her staff has been educating elderly people about the emergency supplies they need.  Charities and nonprofits have also helped. The nonprofit PRxPR, created in response to Maria, is funding solar panels for elderly people and community centers.  One such center in Naguabo had no power as recently as four weeks ago, said Carmen Baez, the group’s co-founder.  “Our installation was it,” she said.

Just as she has won her last 18 matches against Sharapova, the only women‚s player in this era who has rivaled Williams‚s star power and earning power, yet has never rivaled her as a champion.But Williams‚s and Sharapova‚s lives and perspectives are altered now, and both have something different to prove as they prepare for this fourth-round French Open duel and all that might happen beyond it ‚ for the winner ‚ in Paris this spring.Williams, who defeated 11th-seeded Julia G√∂rges, 6-3, 6-4, on Saturday in the finest performance of her comeback from maternity leave, wants to show herself and anyone else concerned that she can resume being the game‚s dominant force as a 36-year-old who gave birth to a daughter, Olympia, just nine months ago. Sharapova, a two-time French Open champion who routed sixth-seeded Karolina Pliskova, 6-2, 6-1, on Saturday, wants to make it unmistakably clear that she can be every bit as good as she was before a 15-month suspension for a doping violation that began in early 2016.Without such meaty challenges, it is possible that both would be retired by now. Sharapova, though only 31, has been playing on tour since she was 14 and training in a professional manner since she was a preteenager fighting for her place in the sun at the IMG Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla., as her father, Yuri, a Russian immigrant, struggled to make the finances work.ImageMaria Sharapova, a two-time French Open champion, routed sixth-seeded Karolina Pliskova, 6-2, 6-1, on Saturday, setting up a fourth-round showdown with Williams.CreditCameron Spencer/Getty ImagesBut Williams‚s and Sharapova‚s ambitions and story lines are about to collide again on Monday in the midst of a women‚s competition that is far more compelling than the men‚s event here.With Williams and Sharapova back in the mix in Paris, finding sufficiently grand venues to showcase all the leading women proved challenging in the third round on Saturday. The world No. 1 Simona Halep, a two-time French Open finalist, had to trek all the way out to the new Court 18 in the hinterlands of Roland Garros to face Andrea Petkovic. Halep prevailed, 7-5, 6-0.Sloane Stephens, the reigning United States Open champion, also played on Court 18 for her three-set tussle earlier in the day with Camila Giorgi, an Italian who has rarely met a risky shot she was not willing to embrace.Giorgi served twice for the match in the third set ‚ at 5-4 and again at 6-5 ‚ before Stephens defused the danger.‚She plays kind of crazy, but in a good way,‚ the 10th-seeded Stephens said. ‚I knew it was going to be a battle, and I just stuck in there and waited for my opportunities.‚Angelique Kerber, a former No. 1 and a two-time Grand Slam champion, ended up on Court No. 1 against Kiki Bertens, a major clay-court threat and a French Open semifinalist two years ago. Kerber won, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4).‚I think for me watching some men‚s tennis right now, it‚s like you know who‚s going to win,‚ said Wim Fissette, Kerber‚s coach. ‚A lot of these men‚s matches, it seems very clear, but the women‚s game, it‚s a very exciting period. You cannot tell who‚s going to win, and you have all these generations coming together.‚ The women‚s fourth round in the top half of the draw is now set. It will be Halep against Elise Mertens; Kerber against Caroline Garcia, the last French player left in singles; Garbi√±e Muguruza, the 2016 French Open champion, who looks like a woman on a mission, against Lesia Tsurenko; and finally Williams against Sharapova. That match will be the latest chapter in a would-be rivalry that has never materialized but has seldom lacked a sharp edge.Sharapova wrote about Williams at length in her recent autobiography, ‚Unstoppable,‚ an intriguing title in light of how many times Williams has stopped her through the years.In Sharapova‚s view, she has never been forgiven for witnessing Williams‚s tears in the locker room of the All England Club after Sharapova, then just 17, upset her in the 2004 Wimbledon final.‚I think Serena hated me for being the skinny kid who beat her, against all odds, at Wimbledon,‚ Sharapova wrote. ‚I think she hated me for taking something that she believed belonged to her. I think she hated me for seeing her at her lowest moment. But mostly I think she hated me for hearing her cry.‚Williams was asked about that analysis on Saturday night. ‚I don‚t have any negative feelings toward her, which was a little disappointing to see in that hearsay book,‚ she said. ‚Especially having a daughter, I feel like negativity is taught. One of the things I always say: I feel like women, especially, should bring each other up.‚Williams also discussed the locker-room incident.‚It‚s a Wimbledon final, you know, so it‚s just, like, I think it would be more shocking if I wasn‚t in tears,‚ she said. ‚And I am emotional, and I do have emotions, and I wear them on my sleeve. You know, I‚m human, so for me, I think it‚s totally normal. I think what happens there should definitely maybe stay there and not necessarily talk about it in a not-so-positive way in a book.‚ Bring on the fourth round, which will be Sharapova and Williams‚s first match since Williams won in the quarterfinals of the 2016 Australian Open, the last tournament Sharapova played before her suspension for using the banned substance meldonium. ‚Well, it‚s been a while,‚ she said of her latest chance to face Williams. ‚And I think a lot has happened in our lives for the both of us in very different ways.‚Sharapova also said: ‚I think any time you play against Serena you know what you‚re up against. You know the challenge that is upon you. You know, despite the record that I have against her, I always look forward to coming out on the court and competing against the best player.‚Williams is actually unseeded, but both she and Sharapova, the No. 28 seed, are clearly gathering momentum in Paris.Sharapova, a former No. 1 who worked her way back into the top 30 after returning to the tour in April 2017, was relentless against Pliskova, mixing baseline bolts with deft drop shots. Williams was settled and routinely on target against G√∂rges, a big-serving German who hit 11 aces to Williams‚s three but who could never get the lead on the scoreboard, struggling to cope with Williams‚s pace and precision.Williams‚s win was quite a performance, all the more so for someone who had not played a clay-court tournament in nearly two years before arriving at Roland Garros.‚Well,‚ said Alexis Ohanian, her husband. ‚She‚s always been a trendsetter.‚",Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova to Reboot a Rivalry After Life Intervened,"June 3, 2018 /  12:11 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-serena-sharapova/serena-williams-calls-maria-sharapovas-book-hearsay-idUSKCN1IZ0GX,"Serena Williams typically has little problem handling Maria Sharapova, but when the two meet Monday in the fourth round of the French Open, Williams might have an extra incentive to continue the dominance.

I think it’s normal,” Williams said, adding that she was surprised to see how much of the book was about her. “It’s a Wimbledon final, you know. So it’s just, like, I think it would be more shocking if I wasn’t in tears,” she said. “I think the book was 100 percent hearsay, at least all the stuff I read and the quotes that I read, which was a little bit disappointing,” Williams said.

Here is our guide to the death tallies, what accounts for their differences and how a new study aims to provide a more definitive account.On Friday, Puerto Rico‚s health department released updated figures breaking down overall deaths on the island by cause in the months after the hurricane.What is The New York Times‚s estimate?In December, The New York Times analyzed vital statistics from the Puerto Rican government that showed that in the 42 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Sept. 20, 2017, 1,052 more people than usual died in Puerto Rico.That figure was particularly striking because thousands of people had left the island, including many with chronic medical conditions. Based on the likelihood that the population there was smaller in the fall of 2017, we would have expected the number of deaths per day to decrease, not increase. To obtain our figure of 1,052, we compared the number of deaths for each day in 2017 with the average of the number of deaths for the same days in 2015 and 2016. The figures came from the Puerto Rican government, which provided us with tables showing the number of deaths per day and deaths broken down by cause. The 2017 numbers were preliminary, so we limited our analysis to September and October.What are the most recent figures released by the government?On June 8, the health department released updated figures to The Times, which showed an even more pronounced trend toward increased deaths in certain categories, lasting into at least October as utility failures persisted. The figures for September 2017 exceed those provided at the time of the Times study, and the department had provided only preliminary data for October until now.In September and October of 2017, 197 people died of sepsis ‚ a complication of severe infection. That was a 55 percent increase from the average for the same months in 2015 and 2016. Those changes could be explained by delayed medical treatment or poor conditions in homes and hospitals.The number of diabetes deaths in September and October 2017, at 666, was 46 percent higher than the average for the same period in the two previous years. Many people with diabetes had difficulty keeping insulin refrigerated, and some had trouble maintaining special diets. Deaths from chronic respiratory diseases and Alzheimer‚s also appeared to be increased. As for suicide deaths, 49 people took their lives in September and October of 2017, whereas in the same months of 2015 and 2016, an average of 33 people died by suicide. Why does a new study suggest there could be more than 4,000 deaths?The study, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the most highly regarded peer-reviewed medical journals, analyzed a longer period than we did. It also used completely different methods.Researchers visited more than 3,000 residences across the island and interviewed their occupants, asking whether anyone in their households had died, and whether the storm and its aftermath might have contributed. Residents reported that 38 people living in their households had died between Sept. 20, 2017, when Hurricane Maria struck, and the end of that year.That toll, converted into a mortality rate, was extrapolated to the larger population and compared with official statistics from the same period in 2016. Researchers arrived at an estimate of roughly 4,600.Is that the most accurate estimate?Because the number of households surveyed was relatively small in comparison to the population‚s size, there was a large margin of error. The true number of deaths beyond what was expected could range from nearly 800 to close to 8,500 people, the researchers‚ calculations showed. The widely reported figure of 4,645 was simply the midpoint of that statistical window, known as a 95 percent confidence interval. Including a midpoint figure in such a report is standard academic practice.The study‚s main finding was that residents of Puerto Rico died at a significantly higher rate during the three months after the hurricane than they did during the same period in the previous year, and that roughly a third of those deaths resulted from delayed medical care. The researchers said in the report that their conclusions were consistent with the analyses of The Times and others.Using the same data and similar methods as The Times, Puerto Rico‚s Center for Investigative Journalism reached a similar estimate, that 1,065 more people than usual had died in September and October. Likewise, the demographer Alexis Santos of Pennsylvania State University, and Jeffrey T. Howard, an independent researcher, compared deaths in 2017 with figures derived from 2010 to 2016 and established an estimate of 1,085 excess deaths. (The increased deaths were concentrated in older age groups, in nursing homes and in emergency departments, Dr. Santos reported in Health Affairs in April.) ‚All these methods complement each other,‚ said Dr. Satchit Balsari, one of the senior authors of the study in the New England Journal of Medicine. ‚By no means is the number we‚re estimating the end-all.‚What was the official death toll?At the time our analysis was released, the official death toll was 64. That number included only people whose death certificates listed Hurricane Maria as a contributor, as certified by the Puerto Rico Forensic Sciences Institute in San Juan. But under pressure from a skeptical public, the Puerto Rican government announced in December that all deaths that had occurred in the months after Hurricane Maria would be reviewed and that people who died either directly or indirectly from the storm and its aftermath would be included in a revised tally.What are direct and indirect deaths?In relation to hurricane deaths, the term ‚direct‚ means those that occurred from drowning or other effects of the storm itself. ‚Indirect‚ deaths include those in which related factors, such as difficulty reaching a hospital for care, or trouble refilling medical prescriptions, played a role. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that medical examiners record both types of deaths as associated with disasters, and the government of Puerto Rico says that it does so.Why was the official count so low?The government acknowledged that its tally of 64 was likely to be a significant undercount. In the days after the storm, with widespread power outages and extreme difficulty moving around the island, it was likely that many storm-related deaths went uninvestigated by the island‚s medical examiner.In November, CNN compiled figures from half the island‚s funeral homes to report that funeral directors believed that 499 more deaths than the official count were tied to the hurricane. In many instances, local doctors had not sent the cases to the forensics bureau for analysis.Also in November, BuzzFeed reported that 911 bodies were cremated following Hurricane Maria without being examined, and that in many cases, funeral home and crematory directors believed that those people had died as a result of the hurricane.What is being done to establish a more precise figure?The government of Puerto Rico has a contract with the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University to conduct a more thorough review. The initial phase of the study will use the island‚s vital records and information from funeral homes, the medical system and the larger public. In a second phase, the researchers will conduct interviews with survivors of those who died. Dr. Lynn R. Goldman, the school‚s dean, said she expected to deliver the initial review this summer, with the results from the second phase following perhaps nine months later.In recent months, pending the completion of the review, the government of Puerto Rico had stopped issuing statistics on deaths. After Puerto Rico‚s Institute of Statistics, CNN, and the Center for Investigative Journalism went to court to demand their release, the commonwealth‚s health department and demographic registrar released a portion of the data on June 1, a table of deaths over all by month. Figures for September and October of 2017 were similar to those that had been released to The Times last year, having increased slightly. Total deaths in November and beyond did not appear elevated compared with previous years. However the population of Puerto Rico had likely declined, so an analysis of the rate of deaths would be needed to detect any possible increases, also accounting for changes in the makeup of the population remaining.",New Data Sheds Light on Death Toll of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico,"May 29, 2018 /  6:47 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-casualties/study-hikes-puerto-ricos-hurricane-maria-death-toll-to-4645-idUSKCN1IU2HG,"(Reuters Health) - Hurricane Maria claimed the lives of 4,645 people in Puerto Rico last year and not the 64 long pegged by the island’s government as the official death toll, according to a survey of thousands of residents by a research team led by Harvard University. The researchers estimated that most victims of the storm died between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, 2017, as a direct or indirect result of Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in 90 years. One-third perished because of delayed or interrupted medical care. While cautioning that the estimate of 4,645 victims may be too low, the researchers said the numbers “underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico.” The tally, reported online on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, is likely to be controversial because it is far higher than previous independent estimates.  The emergency response to the disaster became highly politicized and provoked criticism of President Donald Trump, who was faulted when much of the U.S. territory remained without power for months. Puerto Rico’s government released a statement on Tuesday welcoming the study and saying it would analyze it further. In the aftermath of the storm, Puerto Rico commissioned  George Washington University to conduct an independent study into the death toll, the results of which are due soon. “As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities. We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported,” Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said in the government statement. Graves destroyed during Hurricane Maria in September 2017, are seen at a cemetery, in Lares, Puerto Rico February 8, 2018.  REUTERS/Alvin Baez  The chief author of the new study, Caroline Buckee of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, did not respond to emails requesting comment.  Maria, a major hurricane with winds close to 150 miles (241 km) per hour, caused an estimated $90 billion in damage to an island already struggling economically and many residents have subsequently left. There is a wide margin for error in the study authored by Buckee. While the researchers estimated 4,645 deaths, the actual number could be as low as 793 and as high as 8,498, the study showed.  The tally of 4,645 dead is more than four times higher than a December estimate by the New York Times, which said the actual death toll was probably about 1,052. A Pennsylvania State University study put the number at 1,085. The Buckee team randomly conducted in-person surveys of 3,299 of the estimated 1.1 million Puerto Rican households earlier this year, making sure to include remote areas. Slideshow (2 Images)Respondents were not paid and were asked if a household member had died directly or indirectly as a result of the storm. Missing people were not counted as deaths. Respondents were also asked about deaths within a 5-minute walking distance of their homes. The Buckee team also said that in the aftermath of the storm households went, on average, 68 days without water, 84 days without electricity and 41 days without cell phone coverage. In the most remote areas, 83 percent of the households were still without power by Dec. 31.

As for suicide deaths, 49 people took their lives in September and October of 2017, whereas in the same months of 2015 and 2016, an average of 33 people died by suicide. Why does a new study suggest there could be more than 4,000 deaths?The study, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the most highly regarded peer-reviewed medical journals, analyzed a longer period than we did. It also used completely different methods.Researchers visited more than 3,000 residences across the island and interviewed their occupants, asking whether anyone in their households had died, and whether the storm and its aftermath might have contributed. Residents reported that 38 people living in their households had died between Sept. 20, 2017, when Hurricane Maria struck, and the end of that year.That toll, converted into a mortality rate, was extrapolated to the larger population and compared with official statistics from the same period in 2016. Researchers arrived at an estimate of roughly 4,600.Is that the most accurate estimate?Because the number of households surveyed was relatively small in comparison to the population‚s size, there was a large margin of error. The true number of deaths beyond what was expected could range from nearly 800 to close to 8,500 people, the researchers‚ calculations showed. The widely reported figure of 4,645 was simply the midpoint of that statistical window, known as a 95 percent confidence interval. Including a midpoint figure in such a report is standard academic practice.The study‚s main finding was that residents of Puerto Rico died at a significantly higher rate during the three months after the hurricane than they did during the same period in the previous year, and that roughly a third of those deaths resulted from delayed medical care. The researchers said in the report that their conclusions were consistent with the analyses of The Times and others.Using the same data and similar methods as The Times, Puerto Rico‚s Center for Investigative Journalism reached a similar estimate, that 1,065 more people than usual had died in September and October. Likewise, the demographer Alexis Santos of Pennsylvania State University, and Jeffrey T. Howard, an independent researcher, compared deaths in 2017 with figures derived from 2010 to 2016 and established an estimate of 1,085 excess deaths. (The increased deaths were concentrated in older age groups, in nursing homes and in emergency departments, Dr. Santos reported in Health Affairs in April.) ‚All these methods complement each other,‚ said Dr. Satchit Balsari, one of the senior authors of the study in the New England Journal of Medicine. ‚By no means is the number we‚re estimating the end-all.‚What was the official death toll?At the time our analysis was released, the official death toll was 64. That number included only people whose death certificates listed Hurricane Maria as a contributor, as certified by the Puerto Rico Forensic Sciences Institute in San Juan. But under pressure from a skeptical public, the Puerto Rican government announced in December that all deaths that had occurred in the months after Hurricane Maria would be reviewed and that people who died either directly or indirectly from the storm and its aftermath would be included in a revised tally.What are direct and indirect deaths?In relation to hurricane deaths, the term ‚direct‚ means those that occurred from drowning or other effects of the storm itself. ‚Indirect‚ deaths include those in which related factors, such as difficulty reaching a hospital for care, or trouble refilling medical prescriptions, played a role. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that medical examiners record both types of deaths as associated with disasters, and the government of Puerto Rico says that it does so.Why was the official count so low?The government acknowledged that its tally of 64 was likely to be a significant undercount. In the days after the storm, with widespread power outages and extreme difficulty moving around the island, it was likely that many storm-related deaths went uninvestigated by the island‚s medical examiner.In November, CNN compiled figures from half the island‚s funeral homes to report that funeral directors believed that 499 more deaths than the official count were tied to the hurricane. In many instances, local doctors had not sent the cases to the forensics bureau for analysis.Also in November, BuzzFeed reported that 911 bodies were cremated following Hurricane Maria without being examined, and that in many cases, funeral home and crematory directors believed that those people had died as a result of the hurricane.What is being done to establish a more precise figure?The government of Puerto Rico has a contract with the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University to conduct a more thorough review.

In a second phase, the researchers will conduct interviews with survivors of those who died. Dr. Lynn R. Goldman, the school‚s dean, said she expected to deliver the initial review this summer, with the results from the second phase following perhaps nine months later.In recent months, pending the completion of the review, the government of Puerto Rico had stopped issuing statistics on deaths. After Puerto Rico‚s Institute of Statistics, CNN, and the Center for Investigative Journalism went to court to demand their release, the commonwealth‚s health department and demographic registrar released a portion of the data on June 1, a table of deaths over all by month. Figures for September and October of 2017 were similar to those that had been released to The Times last year, having increased slightly. Total deaths in November and beyond did not appear elevated compared with previous years. However the population of Puerto Rico had likely declined, so an analysis of the rate of deaths would be needed to detect any possible increases, also accounting for changes in the makeup of the population remaining.",New Data Sheds Light on Death Toll of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico,"May 29, 2018 /  3:40 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-hurricane-puertorico/puerto-rican-death-toll-from-hurricane-maria-73-times-official-tally-study-idUSKCN1IU1ZV,"(Reuters Health) - Hurricane Maria claimed 73 times more lives in Puerto Rico than the official death toll of 64, according to new calculations based on a survey of thousands of residents by a team from Harvard and elsewhere. The group estimates that 4,645 people died between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, 2017 as a direct or indirect result of the Category 4 storm, and one-third perished because of delayed or interrupted medical care. The researchers say even that estimate may be too low and the numbers “underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico.” The findings, reported online Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, are likely to be controversial because the tally is far higher than previous independent estimates, the margin of error is wide, and the emergency response to the disaster has become highly politicized after it sparked criticism of President Donald Trump, who promoted a much lower death toll and was faulted when much of the territory remained without power for months. The chief author of the new study, Caroline Buckee of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, did not respond to repeated emails requesting an interview. The storm and its winds of close to 150 miles per hour caused an estimated $90 billion in damage to an island that had been struggling economically. Many residents subsequently left. A closer look at the Buckee calculation shows that while the researchers estimate 4,645 deaths, statistically there’s a 95 percent chance that the actual number could be as low as 793 and as high as 8,498. When the researchers tried to adjust for the fact that people living in single-person households couldn’t report their own death, they estimated 5,740 excess deaths, with a margin of error ranging from 1,506 and 9,889. The Buckee number is more than four times higher than a December estimate by the New York Times, which reported that the actual death toll was probably about 1,052 excess deaths based on data from the island’s vital statistics bureau and a comparison of deaths during a comparable period in the two previous years. The count included suicides. At the same time, the Center for Investigative Journalism said it found 985 additional deaths during September and October. A Pennsylvania State University study put the number at 1,085 (which the Buckee team appears to misreport as 1,218). A CNN survey of funeral directors found 499 additional deaths. To come up with its dramatically-larger estimate, the Buckee team randomly conducted in-person surveys of 3,299 of the estimated 1.1 million Puerto Rican households earlier this year, making sure to include remote areas. Respondents were not paid and were asked if a household member had died directly or indirectly as a result of the storm. Missing people were not counted as deaths. They were also asked about deaths within a five-minute walking distance. More than 93 percent of the people approached completed the survey “Increases in post-hurricane death rates were observed across age groups and were not a reflection of the migration of younger persons out of Puerto Rico after the disaster,” the team reported. The Buckee team also said that households went, on average, 68 days without water, 84 days without electricity and 41 days without cell phone coverage. In the most remote areas, 83 percent of the households were still without power by Dec. 31. Just over 14 percent said they couldn’t get their medicines. The Times analysis found spikes in deaths from severe infections, diabetes, pneumonia, and breathing disorders such as emphysema. The 2018 hurricane season begins June 1.

Here is our guide to the death tallies, what accounts for their differences and how a new study aims to provide a more definitive account.On Friday, Puerto Rico‚s health department released updated figures breaking down overall deaths on the island by cause in the months after the hurricane.What is The New York Times‚s estimate?In December, The New York Times analyzed vital statistics from the Puerto Rican government that showed that in the 42 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Sept. 20, 2017, 1,052 more people than usual died in Puerto Rico.That figure was particularly striking because thousands of people had left the island, including many with chronic medical conditions. Based on the likelihood that the population there was smaller in the fall of 2017, we would have expected the number of deaths per day to decrease, not increase. To obtain our figure of 1,052, we compared the number of deaths for each day in 2017 with the average of the number of deaths for the same days in 2015 and 2016. The figures came from the Puerto Rican government, which provided us with tables showing the number of deaths per day and deaths broken down by cause. The 2017 numbers were preliminary, so we limited our analysis to September and October.What are the most recent figures released by the government?On June 8, the health department released updated figures to The Times, which showed an even more pronounced trend toward increased deaths in certain categories, lasting into at least October as utility failures persisted. The figures for September 2017 exceed those provided at the time of the Times study, and the department had provided only preliminary data for October until now.In September and October of 2017, 197 people died of sepsis ‚ a complication of severe infection. That was a 55 percent increase from the average for the same months in 2015 and 2016. Those changes could be explained by delayed medical treatment or poor conditions in homes and hospitals.The number of diabetes deaths in September and October 2017, at 666, was 46 percent higher than the average for the same period in the two previous years. Many people with diabetes had difficulty keeping insulin refrigerated, and some had trouble maintaining special diets. Deaths from chronic respiratory diseases and Alzheimer‚s also appeared to be increased.

With another hurricane season starting, older Puerto Ricans have little to protect them from another storm on an impoverished island that remains far from fully recovered. Younger and wealthier people have been moving away for years, leaving an older and sicker population in the hands of an underfunded healthcare system. Tens of thousands more have fled since Maria. “We wish we could move, at least for the time he has left,” Reyes said of her husband. Senior citizens make up a larger share of the population here than in all but four U.S. states, according to federal Census data. About half are disabled, more than any state. Forty percent of seniors rely on food stamps, more than three times the percentage in New York state, the second-highest nationally. (For a graphic on Puerto Rico's aging population, see: tmsnrt.rs/2L9N6M0 ) Yet the island has just six nursing homes - with a total of 159 beds - that are certified by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) to provide rehabilitative services. Puerto Rico relies instead on a patchwork of about 800 nursing homes licensed by the island’s Department of Family. They are typically private businesses or nonprofit organizations that care for small numbers of elderly people with limited services - and limited budgets, strained further since Maria. A fragile healthcare system is hardly the only problem that leaves the elderly here - and all Puerto Ricans - vulnerable to another catastrophic storm. About 7,000 houses and businesses still lack power, after Maria leveled a grid that was ill-maintained before the storm. Power utility PREPA has patched together most of the system but remains years away from making the fundamental improvements needed to enable it to withstand another hurricane. “The grid needs to be rebuilt - not just the lines,” PREPA Chief Executive Walter Higgins said.

REUTERS/Alvin BaezMaria also damaged nearly half the island’s levees. Several major water pumps, used to remove floodwater, remain in disrepair.  “God help us, but we definitely can’t handle any more hurricanes,” said Tania Vazquez, the island’s secretary of natural resources.  Governor Ricardo Rossello’s office declined to comment on the island’s hurricane preparedness or on specific efforts to protect the elderly, referring questions to other agencies. Glorimar Andujar, Secretary of the Department of Family, said officials learned a lot from Maria about how to prepare for the next storm. “The emergency plans are much better,” Andujar said, “because we now have an experience that no other generation of agency leaders have experienced.” ELDERLY AT RISK Rosa Iturrizaga runs Hostal de Amigos, a small eldercare residence in San Juan. The home barely broke even before Maria, relying on resident fees of between $2,000 and $3,000 a month. Since then, two of 11 residents moved to the mainland, and insurance has so far not paid for about $40,000 in storm damage, Iturrizaga said. The business carries $500,000 in debt, has fallen behind on loan and tax payments and now loses up to $5,000 a month. “I don’t know what’s kept me going,” Iturrizaga said. “I love doing this, but I’m looking at other things to do with the land.” Another private home, the nonprofit Asilo San Rafael in Arecibo, theoretically charges residents $1,200 a month; in reality, only three of 27 residents pay full price, and at least nine pay nothing, said board member Lucila Oliver. Slideshow (18 Images)Operating costs run about $700,000 annually, with about $110,000 coming from a handful of subsidies from the island’s central government – subsidies she says have declined sharply in recent years as the now-bankrupt Puerto Rican government fell into a fiscal crisis, Oliver said. The Department of Family’s Andujar disputed that the subsidies have declined, but Oliver provided Reuters with balance sheets showing a drop in department funding to $59,000 this fiscal year from $80,000 last year. Maria brought new costs: about $1,200 a month to bring in water tanks, and thousands more on diesel for generators. Oliver said San Rafael is “used to living on the edge,” but says the edge has drawn closer since the hurricanes. Many elderly and disabled here find a way to get by at home, with little care. Some seek help from the Department of Family, applying for a caregiver to come by just a day or two a week, said Andujar. Many are turned away, she said. “The funding is very limited,” she said, “and the need is very big.” PREPARING FOR ANOTHER HIT This hurricane season, the department is making sure it has accurate locations for all licensed nursing homes after cell phone service disruptions stymied the response to Hurricane Maria. The homes, Andujar said, are now required to have 30 days of food on hand, and the department has also requested they have generators and water tanks. She added that about 315,000 elderly people currently receive benefits as part of a $1.27 billion federal allocation under the Nutritional Assistance Program. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) remains on the island and said it has given municipalities money to improve community resilience. Dr. Carmen Sanchez Salgado, Puerto Rico’s ombudsmen for the elderly, said her staff has been educating elderly people about the emergency supplies they need.  Charities and nonprofits have also helped. The nonprofit PRxPR, created in response to Maria, is funding solar panels for elderly people and community centers.  One such center in Naguabo had no power as recently as four weeks ago, said Carmen Baez, the group’s co-founder.  “Our installation was it,” she said.

Only a last-minute request from the governor of the island, bemoaning the “fragile state” of the power grid, managed to keep most of the generators brought by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Puerto Rican soil for another six months.  The remaining generators might help keep the lights on for hospitals or police stations if the island gets hit again during the coming hurricane season, which begins June 1.  Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico last September, leaving 1.5 million homes and businesses in the dark. Both the island’s power utility and the Trump Administration’s Federal Emergency Management Agency were criticized for a slow response. Most power has been restored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers but the electricity grid remains unreliable, and suffered an island-wide blackout last month.   (For a graphic on power restoration after hurricanes, click tmsnrt.rs/2xvCFyU) “The whole world is very nervous about hurricane time,” said Rosalina Abreu Gonzalez, who lives near Mariana, on the eastern side of the island, where power has still not been restored. “There is a real concern - the government hasn’t provided an energy system that is more secure.”    The Army Corps, a unit of the U.S. armed forces, has said  its task is largely complete now that most people have power. About 22,000 customers are still without electricity, most in remote areas, according to the new head of the island’s power utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. “Our mission wasn’t to build a modern resilient system,” Charles Alexander, Director of Contingency Operations and Homeland Security Headquarters at the Army Corps, said at a Senate hearing last week.  On April 29, Governor Ricardo Rossello asked U.S. officials to leave behind 850 generators at critical facilities, along with three larger generators used to keep the grid stable. FEMA agreed to leave the mega-generators and generators for 700 critical facilities. Mega-generators supply 75 megawatts of power, enough to power 75,000 homes.

REUTERS/Alvin BaezNew PREPA Chief Executive Walter Higgins, who has only been on the job for two months, said he is focusing on emergency procedures in the event of another disaster in coming months.  He said there is a plan for building a more resilient grid in the future. Higgins took over from Ricardo Ramos, who resigned as CEO in November after coming under fire for signing unvetted, little-known contractors to restore power, rather than immediately ask for assistance from other utilities. “Unfortunately, pain causes learning, and what we’ve learned is how to get mutual assistance called for and on the island immediately,” Higgins told Reuters.  Still, PREPA’s grid lacks buried power lines or reinforced poles, common in other hurricane prone areas. The power utility ran up an $8 billion debt over many years, largely due to poor bill collection, causing the system to fall into disrepair. “It is very hard to see these messages where the government is saying we’re ready for next season. We’re not,” said Sheylda Diaz, a biology professor who lives near Utuado, in the island’s center, where some lines and poles have yet to be fixed.  The Army Corps will not provide further line restoration after Friday, FEMA said.  “People here have no idea that they are leaving,” said Abreu Gonzalez, who runs a center where people without power can go for meals.   Higgins said he sympathizes with those who want the Corps to remain. “I can understand why somebody would want them to stay longer, as long as there’s a single customer out.” Slideshow (17 Images)Maria hit shortly after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma slammed the U.S. mainland in 2017, but in both cases, power was largely restored within a week.  “I cannot imagine a scenario where 20,000-plus Texans or 20,000 Floridians were without power and FEMA would make that decision,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico. “I think that’s reprehensible.” Reporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by Diane CraftOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Puerto Rico power grid braces for hurricane season,Y

That distinction belonged to Bryson DeChambeau, the 54-hole leader who closed with a one-under 71 at Muirfield Village Golf Club, then won a three-man playoff with an 11-foot birdie on the second extra hole.DeChambeau, 24, tied at 15-under with Byeong Hun An (69) and Kyle Stanley (70). Woods, who started Sunday‚s final round five strokes off the lead, posted an even-par 72 to finish six strokes back, in a tie for 23rd.But if a Most Improved plaque had been awarded, Woods would have won in a rout.After playing his first seven holes in four-over, Woods covered his final 65 in 13-under. A five-time winner of the event, Woods showed significant progress over his 71st-place showing in his last start here, in 2015 at a time when pain loomed as his stiffest opponent. From 2014 to 2017, a bad back limited Woods to 19 starts, and in 10 of those he either missed the cut or withdrew. His best finish in the period was a tie for 10th. It was a far cry from his five-win season on the PGA Tour in 2013, during which his scoring average was 68.97 strokes before the cut and 70.80 on the weekend.In nine official starts in his latest comeback, Woods has two top-five finishes, and has gotten better as the tournaments have unfolded. He is averaging 71.3 strokes the first two days and 69.56 after the initial cut.Playing his way into contention on the weekends poses no problem, because through all the surgeries his competitive compass has remained true. ‚To me, that‚s the easier part,‚ Woods said, adding, ‚I think it‚s trying to get a feel for the start; just finding it and keeping it, it‚s a little bit different now because my body is so different.‚In April 2017, Woods, 42, underwent a last-resort lumbar fusion operation, which involved replacing a disk with a bone graft, causing two vertebrae to grow together and eliminating the motion between them. About a month later, as he recovered at home in Florida while his fellow golfers gathered in Ohio for the 2017 Memorial, Woods was arrested after he was found asleep behind the wheel. His car was running and the brake lights were on. Police toxicology tests found a mix of five powerful painkillers and sedatives in Woods‚s system. In the aftermath of his arrest, golf could not have been further from Woods‚s mind. He entered an inpatient treatment program for addiction to prescription medications and had the driving under the influence charges against him were dropped.‚I was struggling there for a while, and now I‚m on the other end of the spectrum,‚ Woods said Sunday. ‚I don‚t have the pain, which is incredible, and I‚m able to do this again, something I love and something that I‚ve been doing for a very long time. Golf‚s been a part of my life ever since I can remember, and I didn‚t know if I could ever be a part of the game again.‚With 79 Tour victories, including 14 majors, Woods has nothing left to prove. His comeback already has succeeded in winning him a new generation of fans. The pulsing gallery ringing the first tee on Sunday when Woods teed off alongside Whee Kim and J.B. Holmes included dozens of youngsters who weren‚t born when Woods last won a major, at the 2008 United States Open.Dora Nevarrez, 6, and her brother, Nolan, 5, knew Woods mostly as a character in one of the video games they play with their father, Christian, who brought them to Muirfield Village so they could behold Woods in the flesh. Behind the hole, peering out from under the signpost identifying the first tee, Josh Braver snapped a photograph of Woods‚s follow through while his five-year-old son, Luke, gazed at the image on the viewfinder.When asked what he knows about Woods, Luke Braver said, ‚He used to be really, really good until he hurt his back. He won almost every single time he played.‚Along the second fairway, Caleb Williams, 10, and his parents, Heidi and Keith, staked out a spot along the gallery rope. Williams and his mother posed as his father waited to take the photograph until Woods strolled into the background. The one photograph that nobody got was of Woods making the uppercut motion that has become a signature of his victories. Mention the move to Woods and it conjures in his mind an image of his nine-year-old son, Charlie Axel.‚My son tries to do it, which is kind of funny,‚ Woods said. ‚And I keep showing him how to do it.‚It‚s not something that is easily taught. How can Woods ‚ or his son ‚ replicate spontaneity? ‚Those are big moments where it‚s a crescendo,‚ Woods said, adding, ‚It takes us three-and-a-half days or sometimes four days to get into a position where that moment happens. And it just comes out.‚The golf world will see that uppercut again. The 18-time major winner Jack Nicklaus, the Memorial Tournament host, is sure of it. Nicklaus predicted last week that Woods will challenge his all-time major championships record. ‚But whether he does or doesn‚t, it doesn‚t make any difference,‚ Nicklaus said. ‚He‚s still a great athlete and a great golfer.‚Woods‚s appearance on the leader board still makes his opponents‚ hearts race. DeChambeau, who frequently plays practice rounds with Woods during tournament weeks, was asked if he hoped Sunday to have the chance to hold off a fast-charging Woods to win his second P.G.A. Tour title.‚No!‚ DeChambeau said with a laugh. ‚He‚s Tiger Woods.‚",Tiger Woods Didn‚Äôt Win Again.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsThe 14-times major champion played only nine holes on Tuesday, teeing off at the crack of dawn accompanied by last-start Memorial winner Bryson DeChambeau and world number one Dustin Johnson. He completed his work, did a little practice, spoke to the media and left the course to return to his luxury yacht at nearby Sag Harbor before the sun was even over the yardarm. But not before thousands of fans, at least those who avoided the traffic jams outside the course, had taken the chance to catch a glimpse of one of sport’s most famous celebrities. Woods also remains a huge draw with the media and although he predictably said nothing noteworthy on Tuesday, he still drew a standing-room only audience at his news conference. Seats were easier to come by, however, when the game’s current crop of top players, including Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed and Jason Day, paraded through the media center.  “I think everyone realizes it’s different when he (Woods) turns up,” said former world number one Day, no longer in awe of Woods the person after nearly a decade on tour, but still in awe of his achievements, which include 79 PGA Tour victories. “Everyone wants to see what he looks like, or how big is he, or just see the myth behind Tiger Woods. “I know I was like that when I first saw Tiger. I wanted to go on the putting green and putt around next to him, and stare at him.” Yet Day had a different attitude when he was on the practice green on Tuesday, and Woods arrived, with hundreds of fans in tow. “I told him to go away,” Day joked.

Take a look at Facebook, messages from her friends and colleagues urged.Ms. Bateson, a Democrat running for Congress in the California primary on Tuesday, quickly opened up the social network. There, she saw what appeared to be a news article that painted her as underhandedly trying to torpedo the campaign of a rival Democratic candidate. When Ms. Bateson clicked through the article, she was directed to a Facebook page run by Sierra Nevada Revolution, a local progressive group she had clashed with in the past.The article was not a news story, she found, but a political ad paid for by Sierra Nevada Revolution. And while Facebook rolled out new rules on April 6 mandating that campaign ads be clearly labeled and say who had purchased them, Sierra Nevada Revolution‚s ad about Ms. Bateson continued to be targeted to local voters throughout that month without any of those disclosures. ‚It was a perfectly targeted negative campaign ad, but the average person had no idea who had really written it or what their motivations were,‚ said Ms. Bateson, 35, who is running in the Fourth Congressional District, a mountainous stretch of land between Sequoia National Forest and Lake Tahoe. She said she was frustrated by Facebook‚s inability to label the so-called article as a political ad.

He didn‚t say how many.There is another potential loophole in Facebook‚s rules. It appears that one person can go through the verification process and then give the account to someone else. Mr. Smith, for instance, said that while Facebook had authenticated him as a political advertiser, he later handed over control of Sierra Nevada Revolution‚s account to others. That meant others could have used his Facebook verification to post political ads without the social network‚s knowing it was not him. ‚They don‚t know we are five people running it, or however many,‚ Mr. Smith said in a phone interview. ‚It‚s also not consistent. Occasionally, we slip a political ad by Facebook because it‚s not flagged.‚Rob Leathern, Facebook‚s director of product management, said he was ‚grateful‚ that The New York Times had brought the actions of Sierra Nevada Revolution to the company‚s attention. ‚We are looking into it because it‚s against our policies to share passwords or give someone else access to a person‚s Facebook account,‚ he said, adding, ‚We use signals such as two-factor authentication to detect and prevent this type of abuse, but steps like these won‚t stop every attempt to game the system.‚Facebook is being driven by its failure in the 2016 American presidential election to stop Russian agents from using the platform to spread divisive messages to voters.

The archive tool will be rolled out to other countries in coming months, it added. Facebook, which has 2.2 billion monthly active users, pledged seven months ago to create a cache, saying on the eve of U.S. congressional hearings that it wanted to increase transparency about its role in political advertising. Digital services such as Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google and YouTube have upended how political campaigns reach voters in many countries because of their power at targeting ads at narrow audiences and their low cost compared to television ads. Beginning on Thursday, all U.S. ads about elections or political issues on Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, must be labeled with the payer, Rob Leathern, Facebook’s director of ad product management, said in a post on a company blog. The archive begins with ads that ran in May. Clicking on the label will take people to a searchable archive with information such as the campaign budget, how many people saw it and the demographics of those people such as age, location and gender, Leathern said. “We believe that increased transparency will lead to increased accountability and responsibility over time - not just for Facebook but advertisers as well,” Leathern said. Google and Twitter have said that they plan to build similar searchable databases. A Russian propaganda arm tried to tamper in the 2016 U.S. elections by posting and buying ads on Facebook, according to the company and U.S. intelligence agencies. Moscow has denied involvement. In February, the office of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian companies with participating in a criminal and espionage conspiracy. The United States is entering a heated political season ahead Nov. 6 elections that will test the strength of President Donald Trump.

Facebook and Google have faced criticism from lawmakers, users and advocates for campaign finance regulation for their  role in selling political ads after Russians allegedly used fake names to buy ads to sway American voters around the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Unlike most U.S. jurisdictions, both Washington state and the city of Seattle have laws dating to the 1970s that require companies that sell advertising, such as radio stations, to disclose who buys political ads. Other states put the burden of disclosure on the buyers themselves.  A Seattle official said in February that he thought Facebook was in violation of the city’s law, though Seattle has not sued the company.

Yosemite National Park rangers received several 911 calls and rescuers responded but the climbers did not survive the fall, the statement said.El Capitan, a flat-topped cliff that looms more than 3,000 feet above the Yosemite Valley, is a favorite of rock climbers. During the park‚s peak season as many as 80 people may be on the rock formation on any given day, said Ken Yager, president of the Yosemite Climbing Association. The climbers who fell were ‚very experienced,‚ he said, adding: ‚Something weird happened. There‚s no doubt in my mind.‚The Free Blast route that Mr. Wells and Mr. Klein were climbing is about 1,000 feet high, near another popular route called the Nose, said Mr. Yager, who has climbed El Capitan numerous times.‚People from all over the world come to climb it,‚ he said of El Capitan. ‚It‚s definitely a destination climb. It‚s a notch in your belt or a feather in your cap if you‚re a serious climber.‚In September, a man died after rocks broke off El Capitan, falling on him and his wife. She was injured but survived because, she said, her husband shielded her.

The fatal fall occurred at about 8:15 a.m. (1515 GMT) while the pair were scaling the so-called Freeblast route of El Capitan, the agency said. No other details were immediately released as park rangers investigated the incident. The Park Service said the deceased climbers’ identities would be withheld until their families were notified. El Capitan, which looms 3,000 feet (914 m) above the floor of Yosemite Valley, is one of the best-known landmarks in the national park and is considered a world-class challenge for rock climbers. A British climber was killed and his wife was badly injured last September when a rockslide from El Capitan rained boulders onto a popular hiking trail. More than 100 climbing accidents occur in Yosemite every year, and 51 climbers died from traumatic injuries in the park from 1970 through 1990, according to data posted online by the Park Service. Freeblast consists of the first 10 pitches, or stops, of El Capitan’s Salathe Wall - one of the original technical climbing routes to the top of the sheer granite formation.

Kami Rita Sherpa’s 22nd ascent to the summit created a new record for the most visits to the peak of Everest.

Mr. Jansa has closely allied himself with Mr. Orban. But Mr. Jansa could struggle to form a government as most party leaders have rejected the possibility of joining a coalition with him, raising the possibility of an extended period of uncertainty and a new election if coalition talks are deadlocked.On Sunday, he called on parties on the left and right to join him in a new government ‚to face internal and external challenges together.‚Mr. Jansa, a veteran nationalist politician and a dissident during Communist rule, had maintained a lead throughout a two-month election campaign that was marred by disputes over the country‚s turbulent past and allegations of corruption within the established parties. In keeping with his campaign theme, he said on Sunday that migration was the biggest challenge facing Slovenia and Europe. ‚I will say what I have said already before: We are for solidarity, but we are against stupidity,‚ he said, advocating a policy of discouraging migrants from coming to Europe by improving conditions in their own countries.Since the nation‚s independence from Communist Yugoslavia in 1991, politics in Slovenia has had a conservative tinge, but center and leftist parties have largely dominated governing coalitions. The shift to populist parties has taken place since the migration crisis of 2015 and 2016, though the shift has not been as strong as in neighboring Italy, where an anti-establishment government was sworn in last week.The centrist party of Marjan Sarec, a former actor and the mayor of Kamnik, a small town north of the capital, Ljubljana, came in second with 13 percent of the vote. Mr. Sarec, 40, came close to unseating  the incumbent, Borut Pahor, in the presidential election last year.Mr. Sarec cast himself as an anti-establishment candidate and a leader for a new generation of Slovenians who have come of age in a democratic society and whose top concerns are the economy, jobs and social security, including a robust pension system.He congratulated Mr. Jansa for the victory on Sunday, but said his party would heed its vow not to form a coalition with the populist party. If Mr. Jansa fails to cobble together a government, Mr. Sarec would get a chance. If he too failed, the president could call new elections.Finishing third in the poll were the Social Democrats of Dejan Zidan, with 10 percent.The Modern Center Party, led by the outgoing prime minister, Miro Cerar, finished fourth with 9.5 percent ‚ a crushing defeat considering that Slovenia‚s economy grew by 5 percent on his government‚s watch in 2017, one of the fastest rates on the continent, according to the European Union.The election for the 90-seat legislature took place a few weeks earlier than the normal four years because of Mr. Cerar‚s abrupt resignation in March after a major infrastructure project he had backed was shelved. In all, nine parties passed the 4 percent threshold to get into Parliament, including the party of Slovenia‚s first female prime minister, Alenka Bratusek, which received just over 5 percent. With nearly all of the votes counted, voter turnout stood at 51.8 percent.The popularity of Mr. Cerar, a law professor who won a landslide victory in 2014 after forming a party just weeks before the vote, has been dragged down by a crippling public sector strike in this country of two million people that is the birthplace of the American first lady, Melania Trump.His handling of a border dispute with Croatia also brought criticism, as much from his coalition partners as from the right-wing opposition, led by Mr. Jansa.Mr. Jansa made the dispute with Croatia, another European Union member, one of the campaign‚s central issues, accusing Mr. Cerar and his predecessors on the left of giving up territory in an international court ruling.The populist leader also vowed to refuse entry to asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa. Slovenia has participated in the European Union‚s refugee resettlement program, taking in around 200 asylum seekers and Mr. Jansa vehemently opposes Brussels‚ imposition of migrant quotas on member states.An average of 20 people a year are granted international protection in Slovenia.Echoing Mr. Orban of Hungary, he has called the influx of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa a threat to European values and a danger to the continent‚s stability. In 2015, hundreds of thousands of migrants entering Europe passed through Slovenia, usually on the way to other countries, often Germany, to seek asylum. ‚We will never allow this to happen again,‚ Mr. Jansa has said.Mr. Jansa led the government as prime minister from 2004 to 2008 and then again, briefly, in 2012. During his leadership he cracked down on political rivals and the independent news media that he called remnants of the old Communist regime. He also exerted control over major state-run companies.During this campaign, Mr. Jansa aimed to cast himself as a uniter, said Miha Kovac, a political analyst and a lecturer at the University of Ljubljana. ‚It was still Jansa as we know him, blaming others, especially Communists and migrants, for all of the country‚s problems that only he can solve,‚ Mr. Kovac said. ‚But he‚s trying hard to be calmer and not as confrontational.‚Still, Mr. Kovac said, ‚I think it will be very hard for him to form a coalition, perhaps even impossible in the first attempt,‚ adding that it was no easy job for Mr. Sarec either, and that it could well be ‚months if not years of political uncertainty and instability.‚",Slovenia Elections Tilt Another European Country to the Right,"June 3, 2018 /  6:19 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-election-votes/opposition-sds-party-ahead-in-slovenia-election-partial-result-idUSKCN1IZ0T8,"LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Opposition center-right anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) is ahead in the Slovenian general election on Sunday with 26.8 percent of votes after 12.7 percent of votes counted, the State Election Commission said.

In keeping with his campaign theme, he said on Sunday that migration was the biggest challenge facing Slovenia and Europe. ‚I will say what I have said already before: We are for solidarity, but we are against stupidity,‚ he said, advocating a policy of discouraging migrants from coming to Europe by improving conditions in their own countries.Since the nation‚s independence from Communist Yugoslavia in 1991, politics in Slovenia has had a conservative tinge, but center and leftist parties have largely dominated governing coalitions. The shift to populist parties has taken place since the migration crisis of 2015 and 2016, though the shift has not been as strong as in neighboring Italy, where an anti-establishment government was sworn in last week.The centrist party of Marjan Sarec, a former actor and the mayor of Kamnik, a small town north of the capital, Ljubljana, came in second with 13 percent of the vote. Mr. Sarec, 40, came close to unseating  the incumbent, Borut Pahor, in the presidential election last year.Mr. Sarec cast himself as an anti-establishment candidate and a leader for a new generation of Slovenians who have come of age in a democratic society and whose top concerns are the economy, jobs and social security, including a robust pension system.He congratulated Mr. Jansa for the victory on Sunday, but said his party would heed its vow not to form a coalition with the populist party. If Mr. Jansa fails to cobble together a government, Mr. Sarec would get a chance. If he too failed, the president could call new elections.Finishing third in the poll were the Social Democrats of Dejan Zidan, with 10 percent.The Modern Center Party, led by the outgoing prime minister, Miro Cerar, finished fourth with 9.5 percent ‚ a crushing defeat considering that Slovenia‚s economy grew by 5 percent on his government‚s watch in 2017, one of the fastest rates on the continent, according to the European Union.The election for the 90-seat legislature took place a few weeks earlier than the normal four years because of Mr. Cerar‚s abrupt resignation in March after a major infrastructure project he had backed was shelved. In all, nine parties passed the 4 percent threshold to get into Parliament, including the party of Slovenia‚s first female prime minister, Alenka Bratusek, which received just over 5 percent. With nearly all of the votes counted, voter turnout stood at 51.8 percent.The popularity of Mr. Cerar, a law professor who won a landslide victory in 2014 after forming a party just weeks before the vote, has been dragged down by a crippling public sector strike in this country of two million people that is the birthplace of the American first lady, Melania Trump.His handling of a border dispute with Croatia also brought criticism, as much from his coalition partners as from the right-wing opposition, led by Mr. Jansa.Mr. Jansa made the dispute with Croatia, another European Union member, one of the campaign‚s central issues, accusing Mr. Cerar and his predecessors on the left of giving up territory in an international court ruling.The populist leader also vowed to refuse entry to asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa. Slovenia has participated in the European Union‚s refugee resettlement program, taking in around 200 asylum seekers and Mr. Jansa vehemently opposes Brussels‚ imposition of migrant quotas on member states.An average of 20 people a year are granted international protection in Slovenia.Echoing Mr. Orban of Hungary, he has called the influx of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa a threat to European values and a danger to the continent‚s stability. In 2015, hundreds of thousands of migrants entering Europe passed through Slovenia, usually on the way to other countries, often Germany, to seek asylum. ‚We will never allow this to happen again,‚ Mr. Jansa has said.Mr. Jansa led the government as prime minister from 2004 to 2008 and then again, briefly, in 2012. During his leadership he cracked down on political rivals and the independent news media that he called remnants of the old Communist regime. He also exerted control over major state-run companies.During this campaign, Mr. Jansa aimed to cast himself as a uniter, said Miha Kovac, a political analyst and a lecturer at the University of Ljubljana. ‚It was still Jansa as we know him, blaming others, especially Communists and migrants, for all of the country‚s problems that only he can solve,‚ Mr. Kovac said. ‚But he‚s trying hard to be calmer and not as confrontational.‚Still, Mr. Kovac said, ‚I think it will be very hard for him to form a coalition, perhaps even impossible in the first attempt,‚ adding that it was no easy job for Mr. Sarec either, and that it could well be ‚months if not years of political uncertainty and instability.‚",Slovenia Elections Tilt Another European Country to the Right,"June 3, 2018 /  5:17 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-election-exitpolls/anti-immigrant-sds-party-set-win-slovenia-election-exit-polls-idUSKCN1IZ0QU,"LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - The opposition anti-immigrant center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) was set to win the Slovenian general election on Sunday with 24.4 percent of the votes, according to exit polls by the national TV channel TV Slovenia.

16759343,2192,['2018-06-04t14:42:54.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/climate/pruitt-epa-apartment-aide.html,"WASHINGTON ‚ Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, used one of his top aides last year essentially as a personal assistant, having her help him search for an apartment as well as to try to procure a used mattress from the Trump International Hotel, congressional transcripts show.The aide, Millan Hupp, who serves as Mr. Pruitt‚s scheduling director, also helped Mr. Pruitt obtain tickets to last year‚s Rose Bowl football game. The details came from a partial transcript of an interview Ms. Hupp gave last month to congressional investigators, who are looking into Mr. Pruitt‚s first-class travel, spending on security and other management decisions at the E.P.A.The partial transcript was released Monday when Democrats on the House Oversight Committee wrote a letter to Representative Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman, asking him to subpoena documents from the E.P.A. regarding Ms. Hupp‚s real estate work.At the time Ms. Hupp was apartment-hunting for Mr. Pruitt, the administrator was living in, but being urged to leave, a Capitol Hill condo he was renting from the wife of a lobbyist who had business before the E.P.A. Mr. Pruitt paid $50 a night when he was not traveling to live in the unit. In the letter, the ranking Democrats on the oversight panel, Representatives Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland and Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, accused Mr. Pruitt of ‚multiple abuses of authority‚ by using agency staff for personal assignments.Federal ethics standards prohibit such personal assistance by a subordinate, even if the employee is working outside of office hours, as Ms. Hupp said to investigators that she did. One provision bans the use of government time to handle personal matters. A second provision prohibits bosses from asking employees to handle personal matters for them outside of the office.‚Directing or coercing a subordinate to perform such activities during nonduty hours constitutes an improper use of public office for private gain,‚ according to the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the executive branch.Asked on Monday about Ms. Hupp‚s mattress-shopping on behalf of Mr. Pruitt, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the administration is ‚certainly looking into the matter.‚ She added, ‚I couldn‚t comment on the specifics of the furniture used in his apartment.‚Mr. Pruitt, during a Senate hearing in May, acknowledged that Ms. Hupp did unpaid work for him by searching for new housing on her personal time. Ms. Hupp told investigators that she performed the errands for Mr. Pruitt on lunch hours, evenings and vacations. She also said she did not use her official E.P.A. email to conduct Mr. Pruitt‚s personal business. However, documents released to the Sierra Club under the Freedom of Information Act suggest otherwise.In one exchange, in July, Elizabeth Tate Bennett, an E.P.A. senior deputy associate administrator, introduced Ms. Hupp to a Capitol Hill real estate agent, John Walker, describing Mr. Walker as someone who ‚places members of Congress in homes on the hill regularly.‚Ms. Hupp, she told the real estate agent, would like to ‚get coffee with you as well regarding the other matter we discussed previously.‚Reached by phone Monday, Mr. Walker acknowledged the emails and said he ultimately didn‚t work with Ms. Hupp or Mr. Pruitt. ‚Never met with either one of them, never showed them any places,‚ he said.As for the mattress, it remains unclear why Mr. Pruitt wanted it or whether he ultimately purchased one. On September 14, Ms. Hupp sent an email to the general manager of the Trump International Hotel in Washington with the subject line ‚Inquiry on behalf of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.‚Asked about the note, Ms. Hupp told House investigators, ‚I do not recall sending this email, but I do recall there being discussions about the possibility of securing an old mattress from the Trump Hotel.‚‚Discussions with who?‚ the investigators asked.‚With the administrator,‚ Ms. Hupp replied. ‚I don‚t recall specifically, other than he had expressed interest in securing a mattress.‚ Ms. Hupp said she did not remember more of the interaction with the Trump Hotel, including whether a mattress was ever purchased.Amanda Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gowdy, on Monday criticized the decision by Democrats to release part of Ms. Hupp‚s statements. ‚Selectively releasing portions of witness interview transcripts damages the credibility of our investigation and discourages future witnesses from coming forward,‚ she said. ‚The Committee will continue conducting a serious, fact-driven investigation, and therefore will wait until the conclusion of our investigation to release our findings.‚Ms. Gonzalez did not respond when asked if Mr. Gowdy would support using his subpoena power. The Democrats cannot issue one on their own.Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said in a statement, ‚We are working diligently with Chairman Gowdy and are in full cooperation in providing the Committee with the necessary documents, travel vouchers, receipts and witnesses to his inquiries.‚ He declined to provide information about the mattress.Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit ethics group, said that Mr. Pruitt‚s reliance on Ms. Hupp was a violation of federal ethics rules. ‚Pruitt apparently believes the agency is at his service to attend to his personal needs, whims and desires for luxurious accommodations,‚ Mr. Weissman said. ‚Usually public servants think they are working for the public.‚Mickael Damelincourt, the managing director at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, Mary Hapner, a former aide to Mr. Damelincourt who has since left the company, and Noelle Zielinski, a spokeswoman at Trump Organization in New York, each declined to comment on the inquiry by Ms. Hupp about the mattress.","Aide Sought a New Apartment for Scott Pruitt, and an ‚ÄòOld Mattress‚Äô From Trump Hotel","June 14, 2018 /  12:33 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-pruitt/senate-republicans-call-for-hearing-on-pruitt-scandals-idUSKBN1JA01L,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators on Wednesday said embattled Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt should testify before the U.S. Congress to address the list of ethics scandals he faces, but stopped short of calling for his resignation.

REUTERS/Al Drago/File PhotoPruitt came under fire earlier on Wednesday after a report by the Washington Post alleged that the EPA administrator tasked one of his aides and sought help from Republican political donors to find his wife a job. The report prompted Fox News television and radio host Laura Ingraham to call on Pruitt to resign. She is one of the most prominent Conservative voices to call for his resignation. The EPA chief has been under scrutiny the last few months amid reports involving questionable spending on travel and use of security detail, connections with lobbyists and industry groups and use of his office for favors. Pruitt currently faces a dozen investigations by the Office of the Inspector General, Congress and the White House. An EPA spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. President Donald Trump has so far defended Pruitt and praised him for carrying out his policies despite the barrage of negative media reports. On Ingraham’s radio show on Wednesday, fellow Oklahoman and Pruitt ally Republican Senator James Inhofe stopped short of calling for his resignation but said if the stream of scandals does not stop, he would be forced to ask him to step down. “I think something needs to happen to change that,” he told Ingraham. “One of those alternatives would be for him to leave that job.” A spokeswoman for Inhofe later told Reuters that while the senator is not ready to call for resignation, “he has concerns about the reports coming out and wants to hear directly from Pruitt” in a hearing. Other Senate Republicans have started to call for more action against the administrator in recent days. “I support Sen. @JimInhofe’s call for a hearing on EPA Administrator Pruitt’s scandals; and I continue to urge the President to take a hard look at Mr. Pruitt’s actions – as I do not feel that Mr. Pruitt is serving @RealDonaldTrump’s best interests,” Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, chair of the Senate environment committee that has oversight of the EPA, said that he plans to call Pruitt to testify before his panel about his scandals later this year, his spokesman Mike Danylak said. Barrasso also sent a letter this week to Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the appropriations committee for Interior and Environment, to request that there be sufficient funding for the EPA’s Inspector General’s office to carry out several open investigations into Pruitt’s conduct. “The Office of Inspector General has not only expanded a number of ongoing reviews, but has also initiated additional reviews concerning a wide range of allegations related to the Office of the Administrator,” his letter said.

But after losing in the first round of the Miami Open to Naomi Osaka a week later, Williams did not play on tour for nearly two months, choosing to focus on improving her fitness and her game at her coach Patrick Mouratoglou‚s academy near Nice, France.She made the unusual decision to forgo all of the clay court warm-up tournaments before the French Open and arrived here ranked 453rd and unseeded.

Muguruza played only two games on Monday before her opponent, the unseeded Lesia Tsurenko, retired with a right leg injury.This is Sharapova‚s first appearance at the French Open since 2015 because of her 15-month suspension for violating antidoping rules by using the banned substance meldonium. She returned to the tour in April 2017 but was not granted a wild card into last year‚s tournament by the French Open organizers.Sharapova, 31, has struggled with injuries as she has returned to competition, but is back in the top 30 after changing her support team: rehiring her former coach Thomas Hogstedt and hiring a new physiotherapist, Marcin Goszczynski, who has changed many of her routines.‚I was looking forward to my match against Serena today and am disappointed that she had to withdraw,‚ Sharapova said in a statement released by the tournament. ‚I wish her a speedy recovery and hope she returns to the tour soon.‚It is unclear whether Williams will be ready in time for Wimbledon, where she has won seven of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles.

Jun 2, 2018, Paris, France: Serena Williams (USA) reacts  during her match against Julia Goerges (GER) on day seven of the 2018 French Open at Roland Garros.  Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsWhile Sharapova’s quarter-final defeat by Williams at the 2016 Australian Open ended up being the last competitive match the Russian would play for 15 months after she was slapped with a doping ban, her American rival was on a maternity break for most of 2017. Making her Grand Slam comeback in Paris following the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia last September, Williams will renew her fierce on-court rivalry with Sharapova on Monday when they meet in a highly-anticipated fourth-round showdown at the French Open. Their on-court encounters have been a bit of a mismatch because Sharapova has proved to be the kind of prey Williams likes feasting on. Williams, the holder of 23 majors, has strung together an 18-match winning streak against the Russian dating back to 2005. In her autobiography, Sharapova appears to take credit for that run with a bit of reverse psychology — suggesting that the American was so traumatized by her defeat by the then 17-year-old Russian in the 2004 Wimbledon final that she is still driven on by that memory. A clearly unimpressed Williams did not hold back when it came to sharing her thoughts on the matter on Saturday. “The book was 100 percent hearsay, at least all the stuff I read and the quotes that I read, which was a little bit disappointing,” said the 36-year-old. “I have cried in the locker room many times after a loss, and that’s what I have seen a lot of people do. It’s normal. If anything, it shows the passion and the desire and the will that you have... to go out there and do the best. It’s a Wimbledon final... it would be more shocking if I wasn’t in tears. “I think what happens there should definitely stay there and not necessarily (be) talked about in a not-so-positive way in a book.” Apart from Sharapova’s indiscretions, there were other things in the book that irked Williams.  Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 2, 2018  Russia's Maria Sharapova celebrates after winning her third round match against Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova   REUTERS/Christian Hartmann     TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY“The book was a lot about me. I was surprised about that... (because) I didn’t expect to be reading a book about me, that wasn’t necessarily true,” added Williams. “I didn’t know she looked up to me that much or was so involved in my career. “I feel like women should bring each other up. The success of one female should be the inspiration to another.” Sharapova did not want to delve too much into their bitter past on Saturday and instead simply concentrated on the match ahead by saying: “There is a lot of things in her game that she’s done much better than I have. Numbers don’t lie. “Despite the record that I have against her, I always look forward to coming out on the court and competing against the best player.”  As far as Williams is concerned, she does not reserve any special on-court treatment for Sharapova — no matter what the Russian divulged in her autobiography. “Whenever I play her, I go out there the way I play everyone else. I go extremely hard. I don’t play anyone different. I play everyone so hard because they play me really hard and I always have to be ready for it,” said Williams, whose ranking of 451 is not fooling any of her opponents. She showed that she too can indulge in a bit of reverse psychology.  “Quite frankly, she’s probably a favorite in this match, for sure,” Williams said with a smile, knowing full well no one believed her.

I put everything on the court, you know. All for this moment. So it‚s really difficult to be in this situation, but I always, for now in my life, I just always try to think positive and just think of the bigger picture and hopefully the next events and the rest of the year.‚ Williams officially returned to the tour in March at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., where she reached the third round. But after losing in the first round of the Miami Open to Naomi Osaka a week later, Williams did not play on tour for nearly two months, choosing to focus on improving her fitness and her game at her coach Patrick Mouratoglou‚s academy near Nice, France.She made the unusual decision to forgo all of the clay court warm-up tournaments before the French Open and arrived here ranked 453rd and unseeded. But she quickly began hitting high notes once the tournament began, winning three rounds and defeating two seeded players ‚ No. 17 Ash Barty and No. 11 Julia G√∂rges ‚ to set up her latest duel with Sharapova, whom she had defeated 18 times in a row.But Williams said she began feeling pain in her pectoral muscle during her third-round victory over G√∂rges on Saturday. She still decided to play doubles on Sunday night with her sister Venus, a match they lost in three sets. She seemed to struggle with her serve in the later stages of the match. ‚In my doubles yesterday, I tried a lot of different tapings, and I tried lots of different types of support to see how it would feel under match circumstance,‚ Williams said. ‚It didn‚t really get a lot better.‚ This is the first time Williams has withdrawn during a Grand Slam tournament, although she did retire midmatch in the third round of Wimbledon in 1998 against Virginia Ruano Pascual after injuring her left leg in a fall.‚And I have made every sacrifice I could,‚ Williams said. ‚But I also made a promise to myself and to my coach and to my team that if I‚m not at least 60 percent or 50 percent, then I probably shouldn‚t play.‚Numerous coaches, including hers, questioned whether it was a good idea for her to play doubles as well as singles here.‚I was not at all in favor; it‚s been three years now that I‚ve been against her playing doubles,‚ Mouratoglou said in an interview after the surprise withdrawal.Williams ended up playing matches six days in a row, from Tuesday through Sunday. Did that play a role in the injury?‚Of course,‚ Mouratoglou said, adding that he was not told about the pectoral pain after the G√∂rges match.But Williams insisted on Monday that she had needed to play more matches after her extended break from competition, and that Sunday‚s doubles match was important, as she was dealing with the effects of a new injury. ‚I really felt like I needed to because I‚m never going to know how I feel under match play if I didn‚t have that match,‚ she said. She said she wanted to see what treatment might work best against Sharapova.But that matchup, which would have been their first since an Australian Open quarterfinal in 2016, was not to be. She withdrew shortly before the match was to begin after making an unsuccessful attempt to serve without pain during a practice session.‚We made the call very late, because there was rain in the forecast, and if it rained, she had an extra day,‚ Mouratoglou said. ‚So we waited. And it did not rain, so all the elements were against us.‚Sharapova and some of her team, including her coach Thomas Hogstedt, were in the waiting room in Chatrier stadium when tournament organizers informed them of Williams‚s withdrawal.‚Everybody was pumped for the match; it was a little bit like a shock, because we were just ready to go on,‚ said Hogstedt, who added that Sharapova had been ‚playing very well‚ and ‚was ready for the fight.‚She will have to wait for a chance to stop her losing streak against Williams, which dates to 2004. Sharapova has won one set against Williams in the last 10 years and holds a 2-19 record against her over all. ‚It‚s very difficult, because I love playing Maria,‚ Williams said. ‚It‚s just a match I always get up for. You know, it‚s just her game matches so well against mine.‚Sharapova, seeded No. 28, has been in sparkling form this year at Roland Garros, where she has won two of her five Grand Slam singles titles.She is now back into the quarterfinals, where she will face the No. 3 seed Garbi√±e Muguruza, the 2016 French Open champion.

Its vital Office productivity applications and database software are available in cloud versions.Microsoft also competes with Google, IBM, Salesforce and others in the cloud marketplace. All of them are trying to lure software engineers to use their cloud tools and services. The more programmers on a company‚s platform, the more software applications are created, attracting customers and still more developers ‚ a flywheel of growth and profit. ‚The strategic battle in the tech world is for developers,‚ said Frank Gens, chief analyst for IDC, a research firm. ‚For Microsoft, the GitHub deal is about strengthening and widening its relationships with developers.‚Satya Nadella, Microsoft‚s chief executive, said the deal would advance Microsoft‚s ambitions in cloud computing and bring smarter software to every industry, on any digital device.‚Developers are the builders of this new era, writing the world‚s code,‚ Mr. Nadella wrote in a blog post. ‚And GitHub is their home.‚GitHub, founded in 2008 and based in San Francisco, was created largely as a community for software developers to share programming tools and code. It has been a champion of the open-source software movement, with its ethos of freely sharing code in public.Today, GitHub is used by a wide range in the tech community, from lone programmers to the nation‚s largest companies. Developers can share code, make comments and buy software tools. They work in digital storage spaces, called repositories. Some are open to all users; others are closed to members of a team. GitHub now has more than 85 million code repositories. Individuals can use GitHub for free. But there are monthly subscription charges for extra storage, development tools and private repositories. The company does not disclose its revenue, but analysts estimate it is running at $200 million a year.The open-source model was once anathema to Microsoft, the largest commercial software company, which had favored keeping its code proprietary. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft‚s former chief executive, once called Linux, the popular open-source operating system, a ‚cancer‚ in the body of the technology business.But Microsoft has come to embrace open-source tools. Today, Microsoft is the most active corporation on GitHub, with more than two million contributions of code to GitHub projects.GitHub, seeking to establish a profitable business, has increasingly hosted corporate projects on its platform for a fee. Those ventures have typically used open-source software development techniques while keeping some code proprietary.Executives from both companies insisted that GitHub would remain technologically neutral, welcoming developers using any code or any cloud service, rather than a Microsoft walled garden. The proof, analysts say, will be in how GitHub operates under Microsoft ownership.‚Developers by their nature are often suspicious of corporate ambitions,‚ said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. ‚Microsoft will have to demonstrate its willingness to put the interests of developers ahead of any Microsoft-specific agenda.‚The $7.5 billion purchase, an all-stock deal, is the second-largest acquisition Microsoft has made since Mr. Nadella became chief executive in early 2014. The bigger deal came in 2016, when Microsoft bought LinkedIn, the social network for professional workers, for $26.2 billion. (GitHub ranks third in Microsoft‚s history, also behind the $8.5 billion purchase of Skype in 2011.) If GitHub will remain a neutral home for developers, as Microsoft insists, why did the company pay so handsomely to own it?In an interview, Nat Friedman, corporate vice president for developer services at Microsoft, explained that ownership would give the company the confidence to make a greater commitment to GitHub ‚ ‚to confidently go all-in on GitHub.‚Microsoft, Mr. Friedman said, will make nearly all its software-building tools available on GitHub. Over time, as Microsoft shows itself to be a reliable corporate steward of GitHub and is willing to invest in its growth, he said, Microsoft should benefit as more developers adopt its software.‚It‚s a matter of building trust with developers,‚ said Mr. Friedman, who will become chief executive of GitHub when the deal closes, which is expected to be this year. ‚You earn the right to be considered for other things.‚With GitHub, Microsoft is making a move similar to its LinkedIn acquisition ‚ buying the leading marketplace in its field. ‚Microsoft is rolling up another platform,‚ said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology‚s Sloan School of Management.GitHub has become far more than a platform for software development. It is where developers demonstrate their skills. Software engineers routinely include links to their GitHub projects on their r√©sum√©s, and companies scout for job candidates on GitHub.‚It‚s the de facto tool for recruiting technical talent,‚ Julio Avalos, GitHub‚s chief strategy officer, said in an interview this year. The $7.5 billion transaction promises a lucrative payday for GitHub‚s venture backers. The start-up had raised a total of $350 million ‚ a $100 million round in 2012, led by Andreessen Horowitz, and a $250 million round in 2015, led by Sequoia Capital.The multibillion-dollar deal is a long way from GitHub‚s hobbyist, hacker origins. In a blog post, Chris Wanstrath, the company‚s chief executive and a co-founder, who will become a technical fellow at Microsoft, wrote that when GitHub started up a decade ago, he could have ‚never imagined‚ the outcome announced on Monday.‚Git was a powerful but niche tool, clouds were just things in the sky,‚ he wrote, ‚and Microsoft was a very different company.‚","Microsoft Buys GitHub for $7.5 Billion, Moving to Grow in Coding‚Äôs New Era","June 4, 2018 /  1:07 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/github-inc-ma-microsoft-corp/microsoft-to-buy-coding-site-github-for-7-5-bln-idUSL3N1T63YB,June 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday it would buy privately held coding website GitHub Inc for $7.5 billion in all-stock deal.

For more,  sign up for our California Today newsletter.LOS ANGELES ‚ For more than three decades, political pundits have referred to Latino voters as a ‚sleeping giant,‚ to describe a demographic reality that has yet to translate to clear political force. With each presidential election, much is written about how important Latino votes could be in securing the White House.In California, Latinos make up nearly 40 percent of the overall population, already outnumbering non-Hispanic whites. Even if their political clout isn‚t yet fully realized, Latinos‚ political engagement in California is impressive, especially when compared with states like Arizona and Texas. There are all-Latino City Councils, Latinos leading the State Legislature and Latinos running the largest cities in California. Has the giant already woken?How many of the state‚s voters are Latino?Latinos make up 34 percent of the state‚s adult population, but they account for just 18 percent of likely voters, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Although Latinos live all over the state, Latino voters are disproportionately concentrated in urban areas. More than any other issue, a 1994 ballot initiative called Proposition 187 is credited with turning a generation of Latinos into reliable Democrats. Republicans led by Pete Wilson, who was governor at the time, backed the ballot initiative, which sought to deny public services to undocumented immigrants. The measure passed and Mr. Wilson was re-elected, but the victory was only a short-term one, with lasting partisan consequences: Among Latinos who have registered to vote in the last year, just 3 percent registered as Republicans, according to Fernando Guerra, a professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.Are Latinos any more or less likely to vote than whites?In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, many analysts predicted a ‚Trump effect‚ ‚ expecting that Latinos would turn out at a significantly higher rate because of the candidate‚s anti-immigrant rhetoric. But there was little sign of significant change at the polls. According to the Census bureau, voter turnout among California Latinos in 2016 hovered around 33 percent, an uptick from 2014 but no more than in past presidential election years.The turnout rate for the 2014 midterms was about 25 percent for Latinos, compared with 37 percent for the state overall and 47 percent for non-Hispanic whites.‚In general, they haven‚t turned out to vote more than anyone else, they have actually done less,‚ said Roberto Suro, a professor of public policy and journalism at the University of Southern California, who has written about Latinos and politics for decades. ‚Turnout has underperformed nationally, with few exceptions.‚Here are the pieces you need to read to understand the state, and what may happen there on Tuesday.‚¢ What is a jungle primary and how does it work? ‚¢The two leading Democratic candidates must contend with Jerry Brown‚s long shadow ‚¢ Republicans are struggling to field candidates on the ballot in November.‚¢ Meanwhile, Democrats, too, are wary of a possible disaster.‚¢ Everything you need to know about the top races in the state.Several former Republican strongholds with growing Latino populations, like Orange County, chose Hillary Clinton in 2016, but that swing could also be attributed to wealthy white voters casting ballots against Mr. Trump. And some political scientists fault California candidates and their campaigns for not doing enough to reach out to Latino voters.‚The metaphor, sort of a sleeping giant, suggests that they are apathetic and unengaged and are asleep,‚ Francisco Pedraza, a professor at University of California, Riverside, said of Latino voters. ‚The key difference is that in districts where they have yet to turn blue, you look at campaign spending and there‚s not a lot of it. We‚re leaving votes on the table if we‚re not investing in those areas.‚On a recent afternoon in downtown Fullerton, one of the largest cities in the 39th Congressional District, few people even seemed to know there was a primary election coming up, though campaign signs lined the main street.‚Nobody has called me, knocked on my door, asked me for my vote,‚ said Carlos Rivera, a 32-year-old data analyst who lives in Fullerton. ‚I vote when there‚s something I care about. I‚m not sure whether that‚s true this time.‚Latinos have faced voter intimidation in the state for generations. In the Central Valley, for example, farm owners would threaten to fire workers if their names showed up on voter rolls, according to Matt Barreto, who runs Latino Decisions, a polling firm. Latinos have also won court battles over the ways local voting districts have been drawn to dilute their voting power. There are undoubtedly other factors as well. For example, across ethnic lines, people with college degrees are more likely to vote, and Latinos lag behind non-Hispanic whites in higher education. They also have disproportionately higher rates of poverty, which is associated with decreased voting.Which races have Latinos given an edge to? If Latinos are the primary key to turning California blue, as many people in the state say, it‚s fair to argue that they can sway any election when the candidates are closer than 10 percentage points apart in the polls.A clear example is the area now covered by the 36th Congressional District, where Raul Ruiz won in 2012 in large part by focusing on the growing Latino population in the district, which includes part of Palm Springs and other large swaths of the Coachella Valley. Before his victory, the area had not been represented by a Democrat since the 1980s.Change came even more quickly in Orange County, when Loretta Sanchez defeated a longtime Republican congressman, Bob Dornan, in 1996 in a district that is now seen as solidly Democratic. But that trend has yet to take hold in the wealthiest parts of Orange County or in the reliably conservative Central Valley.Democrats and Republicans have a mixed record of focusing on Latino voter turnout. Mr. Barreto said there has been a general reluctance to spend money for Spanish-language campaign advertising, which often boosts Latino turnout. But he said there were ‚very early signs‚ that those attitudes were changing, and that Democratic groups in particular were willing to invest money in getting Latinos to the polls for the midterms.Where will Latinos matter during this election?It depends on how many show up to vote. Antonio Villaraigosa once personified Latino political power ‚ he was the first Latino elected mayor of Los Angeles in modern history. But his campaign for governor has struggled. He is counting on a large turnout among Latino voters to lift him to the No. 2 spot in the primary, and thus onto the November ballot. But some polls show him getting the nod from fewer than 25 percent of likely Latino voters. While Latinos are generally expected not to turn out as heavily as non-Hispanic whites do, exit polls for state elections in New Jersey and Virginia last year showed that Latino turnout was up modestly compared with past midterm elections. ‚If Latinos were turning out en masse for him, he wouldn‚t be in the singles,‚ Mr. Suro said of Mr. Villaraigosa‚s poll standing in the crowded primary field. ‚This is the first credible Latino running for governor in forever. You‚d think, if there‚s a groundswell of Latinos going and saying ‚here‚s our chance,‚ you‚d see it in the numbers by now.‚Marisol Fuentes, a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother, said she was not drawn to candidates merely by a shared ethnicity. Rather, she said she was confident that she would vote for the ‚most liberal‚ candidates she could find.‚We have a president attacking everything I stand for, and a congressman who lets him get away with it,‚ she added. ‚I will tell anyone who listens that we have to get people in office who will fight for rights for everyone.‚In the congressional races, Latinos make up roughly one-quarter of registered voters in the race to succeed Ed Royce to represent eastern Los Angeles County and northern Orange County. They also account for roughly 25 percent of voters in the battle to unseat Steve Knight, a Republican who represents the northern suburbs of Los Angeles. And they are a significant chunk of voters in districts in the Central Valley and San Diego where Republicans are facing tough re-election bids. If Latinos prove to be a force that pushes Democrats over the top, nobody in California is likely to argue about their power sleeping.",How Latino Voting Power Will Count in the California Primary,"June 6, 2018 /  8:09 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-california-commentary/commentary-the-problem-with-californias-primary-idUSKCN1J22RK,"Polls indicate that the 2018 midterms are shaping up very well for the Democratic Party. But Tuesday’s primary in California is a potent reminder of how misguided reforms to the electoral system can frustrate the will of the voters.  Hans Keirstead (L) and Harley Rouda, primary candidates in California's 48th congressional district. REUTERS/via Handouts	The problem is not that these reforms hurt the Democratic Party per se, but that they’re a “fix” that don’t solve the original problem. And issues created by California’s reforms are compounded by a flaw in the American electoral system that isn’t unique to the state: an electoral system that effectively throws out important information about what voters want. This is true regardless of the final results in California.  	The problems in California are a result of the state’s “top-two” or “jungle primary” system. In every state other than California, Washington and Louisiana, parties pick their candidates for the general election in primary elections. But in a top-two system, there is a single, nonpartisan primary, and the top two candidates advance irrespective of partisan affiliation. In most races, this change is pointless – producing the same Democratic and Republican candidates that would be produced by a partisan primary. (For example, the 2016 Washington top-two Senate primary led to a general election contest between Democratic candidate Patty Murray and Republican candidate Chris Vance.) 	But in other situations, the system can produce undemocratic results. This year’s primary in California’s 48th congressional district (CA-48) is a case in point. The Orange County district currently represented by Republican Dana Rohrabacher has historically had a strong Republican lean that in an ordinary year would have made it difficult to recruit even a single viable Democratic candidate. But with a potential Democratic wave in November, changing demographics making the district competitive enough that Hillary Clinton carried it in 2016, and with Rohrabacher being particularly vulnerable because of his persistent advocacy for closer ties to Russia, the Democrats have the opposite problem: too many viable candidates.  	In addition to numerous minor candidates who took critical votes on Tuesday, the party has been divided between two Democratic frontrunners: businessman Harley Rouda and scientist Hans Keirstead. Keirstead has a more liberal record (Rouda was a registered Republican until recently), but Kierstead has faced accusations, which he denies, that he punched a woman outside a night club. (The allegations were included in a complaint to his former employer, which investigated the charges and cleared Kierstead of any wrongdoing.) As of publication time on Wednesday, the preliminary vote count indicated that Rohrabacher had advanced to the general election, with Rouda in second place thanks to a slim lead over Keirstead. 	In the vast majority of states, the selection of too many candidates from the same party wouldn’t be a problem. The party would choose its candidate in a primary, and then general election voters would choose between that candidate and those of other parties. But in the top-two system, if enough Democrats split the vote it’s very possible that no Democrat will appear on the ballot even if the Democratic candidate would win the general election. This is a travesty for democracy.  	And it is not the only perverse outcome created by the top-two system. One of the goals of eliminating partisan primaries is to reduce the role of parties in selecting candidates. But because the failure to rally around a candidate before the fact can lead to the party being excluded from a winnable general election, if anything the top-two primary encourages more meddling from party elites. This actually leads to the worst of both worlds. 	On one hand, many party activists resent – not without reason – official party organs intervening in competitive primary campaigns. Party elites aren’t necessarily that good at predicting who is electable and they appear to be meddling. There is no single entity representing the Democratic Party that can ensure coordination around candidates in a jungle primary. In the case of CA-48, the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) supports Rouda, but the state party supports Keirstead. And if party elites were on the same page, their power would still be limited – it’s not at all uncommon for primary candidates backed by the DCCC to lose. In a typical primary system, these conflicts can be resolved by the voters. But the top-two encourages more heavy-handed intervention from the party, which results in hostility towards the party and no guarantee of the desired election outcome.  	It’s not just the top-two primary that’s the problem. An even bigger issue in U.S. politics, relevant in more states, is plurality voting – the system that records a single vote per voter and awards the top candidate(s) as winner(s) even if they fall short of a majority. Ranked-choice or other systems that allow voters to rank preferences for multiple candidates would greatly reduce perverse outcomes. A Rouda or Keirstead voter could name the other major Democratic candidate their second choice and avoid the risk of producing their least-preferred outcome – a general election with no Democratic nominees. 	Improving the electoral system wouldn’t just help California. The conservative columnist David Brooks recently made the case for multimember districts and ranked-choice voting. This would not merely allow voters to vote for their favorite candidate without risking their least-favored outcome, it would also address another major democratic infirmity by making it much harder to gerrymander House districts. The potentially perverse results in California should provide an impetus to consider reforms that would produce more democratic results beyond the Golden State.

For more,  sign up for our California Today newsletter.LOS ANGELES ‚ For more than three decades, political pundits have referred to Latino voters as a ‚sleeping giant,‚ to describe a demographic reality that has yet to translate to clear political force. With each presidential election, much is written about how important Latino votes could be in securing the White House.In California, Latinos make up nearly 40 percent of the overall population, already outnumbering non-Hispanic whites. Even if their political clout isn‚t yet fully realized, Latinos‚ political engagement in California is impressive, especially when compared with states like Arizona and Texas. There are all-Latino City Councils, Latinos leading the State Legislature and Latinos running the largest cities in California. Has the giant already woken?How many of the state‚s voters are Latino?Latinos make up 34 percent of the state‚s adult population, but they account for just 18 percent of likely voters, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Although Latinos live all over the state, Latino voters are disproportionately concentrated in urban areas. More than any other issue, a 1994 ballot initiative called Proposition 187 is credited with turning a generation of Latinos into reliable Democrats. Republicans led by Pete Wilson, who was governor at the time, backed the ballot initiative, which sought to deny public services to undocumented immigrants. The measure passed and Mr. Wilson was re-elected, but the victory was only a short-term one, with lasting partisan consequences: Among Latinos who have registered to vote in the last year, just 3 percent registered as Republicans, according to Fernando Guerra, a professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.Are Latinos any more or less likely to vote than whites?In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, many analysts predicted a ‚Trump effect‚ ‚ expecting that Latinos would turn out at a significantly higher rate because of the candidate‚s anti-immigrant rhetoric. But there was little sign of significant change at the polls. According to the Census bureau, voter turnout among California Latinos in 2016 hovered around 33 percent, an uptick from 2014 but no more than in past presidential election years.The turnout rate for the 2014 midterms was about 25 percent for Latinos, compared with 37 percent for the state overall and 47 percent for non-Hispanic whites.‚In general, they haven‚t turned out to vote more than anyone else, they have actually done less,‚ said Roberto Suro, a professor of public policy and journalism at the University of Southern California, who has written about Latinos and politics for decades. ‚Turnout has underperformed nationally, with few exceptions.‚Here are the pieces you need to read to understand the state, and what may happen there on Tuesday.‚¢ What is a jungle primary and how does it work? ‚¢The two leading Democratic candidates must contend with Jerry Brown‚s long shadow ‚¢ Republicans are struggling to field candidates on the ballot in November.‚¢ Meanwhile, Democrats, too, are wary of a possible disaster.‚¢ Everything you need to know about the top races in the state.Several former Republican strongholds with growing Latino populations, like Orange County, chose Hillary Clinton in 2016, but that swing could also be attributed to wealthy white voters casting ballots against Mr. Trump. And some political scientists fault California candidates and their campaigns for not doing enough to reach out to Latino voters.‚The metaphor, sort of a sleeping giant, suggests that they are apathetic and unengaged and are asleep,‚ Francisco Pedraza, a professor at University of California, Riverside, said of Latino voters. ‚The key difference is that in districts where they have yet to turn blue, you look at campaign spending and there‚s not a lot of it. We‚re leaving votes on the table if we‚re not investing in those areas.‚On a recent afternoon in downtown Fullerton, one of the largest cities in the 39th Congressional District, few people even seemed to know there was a primary election coming up, though campaign signs lined the main street.‚Nobody has called me, knocked on my door, asked me for my vote,‚ said Carlos Rivera, a 32-year-old data analyst who lives in Fullerton. ‚I vote when there‚s something I care about. I‚m not sure whether that‚s true this time.‚Latinos have faced voter intimidation in the state for generations. In the Central Valley, for example, farm owners would threaten to fire workers if their names showed up on voter rolls, according to Matt Barreto, who runs Latino Decisions, a polling firm. Latinos have also won court battles over the ways local voting districts have been drawn to dilute their voting power. There are undoubtedly other factors as well. For example, across ethnic lines, people with college degrees are more likely to vote, and Latinos lag behind non-Hispanic whites in higher education. They also have disproportionately higher rates of poverty, which is associated with decreased voting.Which races have Latinos given an edge to? If Latinos are the primary key to turning California blue, as many people in the state say, it‚s fair to argue that they can sway any election when the candidates are closer than 10 percentage points apart in the polls.A clear example is the area now covered by the 36th Congressional District, where Raul Ruiz won in 2012 in large part by focusing on the growing Latino population in the district, which includes part of Palm Springs and other large swaths of the Coachella Valley. Before his victory, the area had not been represented by a Democrat since the 1980s.Change came even more quickly in Orange County, when Loretta Sanchez defeated a longtime Republican congressman, Bob Dornan, in 1996 in a district that is now seen as solidly Democratic. But that trend has yet to take hold in the wealthiest parts of Orange County or in the reliably conservative Central Valley.Democrats and Republicans have a mixed record of focusing on Latino voter turnout. Mr. Barreto said there has been a general reluctance to spend money for Spanish-language campaign advertising, which often boosts Latino turnout. But he said there were ‚very early signs‚ that those attitudes were changing, and that Democratic groups in particular were willing to invest money in getting Latinos to the polls for the midterms.Where will Latinos matter during this election?It depends on how many show up to vote. Antonio Villaraigosa once personified Latino political power ‚ he was the first Latino elected mayor of Los Angeles in modern history. But his campaign for governor has struggled. He is counting on a large turnout among Latino voters to lift him to the No. 2 spot in the primary, and thus onto the November ballot. But some polls show him getting the nod from fewer than 25 percent of likely Latino voters. While Latinos are generally expected not to turn out as heavily as non-Hispanic whites do, exit polls for state elections in New Jersey and Virginia last year showed that Latino turnout was up modestly compared with past midterm elections. ‚If Latinos were turning out en masse for him, he wouldn‚t be in the singles,‚ Mr. Suro said of Mr. Villaraigosa‚s poll standing in the crowded primary field. ‚This is the first credible Latino running for governor in forever. You‚d think, if there‚s a groundswell of Latinos going and saying ‚here‚s our chance,‚ you‚d see it in the numbers by now.‚Marisol Fuentes, a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother, said she was not drawn to candidates merely by a shared ethnicity. Rather, she said she was confident that she would vote for the ‚most liberal‚ candidates she could find.‚We have a president attacking everything I stand for, and a congressman who lets him get away with it,‚ she added. ‚I will tell anyone who listens that we have to get people in office who will fight for rights for everyone.‚In the congressional races, Latinos make up roughly one-quarter of registered voters in the race to succeed Ed Royce to represent eastern Los Angeles County and northern Orange County. They also account for roughly 25 percent of voters in the battle to unseat Steve Knight, a Republican who represents the northern suburbs of Los Angeles. And they are a significant chunk of voters in districts in the Central Valley and San Diego where Republicans are facing tough re-election bids. If Latinos prove to be a force that pushes Democrats over the top, nobody in California is likely to argue about their power sleeping.",How Latino Voting Power Will Count in the California Primary,"June 5, 2018 /  4:10 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-california-commentary/commentary-the-problem-with-californias-primary-idUSKCN1J1212,"Polls indicate that the 2018 midterms are shaping up very well for the Democratic Party. But Tuesday’s primary in California is a potent reminder of how misguided reforms to the electoral system can frustrate the will of the voters. Hans Keirstead (L) and Harley Rouda, primary candidates in California's 48th congressional district. REUTERS/via HandoutsThe problem is not that these reforms hurt the Democratic Party per se, but that they’re a “fix” that don’t solve the original problem. And issues created by California’s reforms are compounded by a flaw in the American electoral system that isn’t unique to the state: an electoral system that effectively throws out important information about what voters want. This is true regardless of the final results in California. The problems in California are a result of the state’s “top-two” or “jungle primary” system. In every state other than California, Washington and Louisiana, parties pick their candidates for the general election in primary elections. But in a top-two system, there is a single, nonpartisan primary, and the top two candidates advance irrespective of partisan affiliation. In most races, this change is pointless – producing the same Democratic and Republican candidates that would be produced by a partisan primary. (For example, the 2016 Washington top-two Senate primary led to a general election contest between Democratic candidate Patty Murray and Republican candidate Chris Vance.)  More in CommentaryReuters columnists discuss the Trump - Kim nuclear summitBut in other situations, the system can produce undemocratic results. This year’s primary in California’s 48th congressional district (CA-48) is a case in point. The Orange County district currently represented by Republican Dana Rohrabacher has historically had a strong Republican lean that in an ordinary year would have made it difficult to recruit even a single viable Democratic candidate. But with a potential Democratic wave in November, changing demographics making the district competitive enough that Hillary Clinton carried it in 2016, and with Rohrabacher being particularly vulnerable because of his persistent advocacy for closer ties to Russia, the Democrats have the opposite problem: too many viable candidates. In addition to numerous minor candidates who took critical votes on Tuesday, the party has been divided between two Democratic frontrunners: businessman Harley Rouda and scientist Hans Keirstead. Keirstead has a more liberal record (Rouda was a registered Republican until recently), but Kierstead has faced accusations, which he denies, that he punched a woman outside a night club. (The allegations were included in a complaint to his former employer, which investigated the charges and cleared Kierstead of any wrongdoing.) As of publication time on Wednesday, the preliminary vote count indicated that Rohrabacher had advanced to the general election, with Rouda in second place thanks to a slim lead over Keirstead. In the vast majority of states, the selection of too many candidates from the same party wouldn’t be a problem. The party would choose its candidate in a primary, and then general election voters would choose between that candidate and those of other parties. But in the top-two system, if enough Democrats split the vote it’s very possible that no Democrat will appear on the ballot even if the Democratic candidate would win the general election. This is a travesty for democracy. And it is not the only perverse outcome created by the top-two system. One of the goals of eliminating partisan primaries is to reduce the role of parties in selecting candidates. But because the failure to rally around a candidate before the fact can lead to the party being excluded from a winnable general election, if anything the top-two primary encourages more meddling from party elites. This actually leads to the worst of both worlds. On one hand, many party activists resent – not without reason – official party organs intervening in competitive primary campaigns. Party elites aren’t necessarily that good at predicting who is electable and they appear to be meddling. There is no single entity representing the Democratic Party that can ensure coordination around candidates in a jungle primary. In the case of CA-48, the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) supports Rouda, but the state party supports Keirstead. And if party elites were on the same page, their power would still be limited – it’s not at all uncommon for primary candidates backed by the DCCC to lose. In a typical primary system, these conflicts can be resolved by the voters. But the top-two encourages more heavy-handed intervention from the party, which results in hostility towards the party and no guarantee of the desired election outcome. It’s not just the top-two primary that’s the problem. An even bigger issue in U.S. politics, relevant in more states, is plurality voting – the system that records a single vote per voter and awards the top candidate(s) as winner(s) even if they fall short of a majority. Ranked-choice or other systems that allow voters to rank preferences for multiple candidates would greatly reduce perverse outcomes. A Rouda or Keirstead voter could name the other major Democratic candidate their second choice and avoid the risk of producing their least-preferred outcome – a general election with no Democratic nominees.

That wiped out the appeals court‚s ruling as precedent.The case attracted wide attention after the Justice Department, in an unusual Supreme Court filing in November, accused the A.C.L.U. of serious professional misconduct in the case of the teenager, who was known as Jane Doe. She obtained an abortion in October over the government‚s objection after an appeals court allowed it.The government said the civil liberties group had misled it about the timing of the abortion, frustrating its ability to seek a stay from the Supreme Court. The group denied the accusations and said it had acted properly and diligently. ‚The Trump administration blocked Jane Doe from getting constitutionally protected care for a month and subjected her to illegal obstruction, coercion and shaming as she waited,‚ David Cole, the A.C.L.U.‚s legal director, said at the time. ‚After the courts cleared the way for her to get her abortion, it was the A.C.L.U.‚s job as her lawyers to see that she wasn‚t delayed any further ‚ not to give the government another chance to stand in her way.‚The appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, ruled in favor of the teenager, who was in government custody in Texas, on Oct. 24. According to the Justice Department‚s brief, lawyers for the A.C.L.U. initially indicated that the abortion would take place on Oct. 26. On that understanding, the department‚s brief said, it had planned to file an emergency application for a stay in the Supreme Court on Oct. 25.Under Texas law, women must attend a counseling session at least 24 hours before having an abortion with the doctor who will perform the procedure. The teenager had attended such a session on Oct. 19, but the doctor she consulted was initially thought to be unavailable to perform the procedure.Had a new doctor been required, the teenager would presumably have received counseling on Oct. 25 and obtained the abortion on Oct. 26. It turned out that the original doctor was available after all, and the teenager received the abortion early in the morning on Oct. 25.In its brief, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to vacate the appeals court‚s ruling, which the court did. It also asked the justices to consider punishing the A.C.L.U.‚s lawyers. The Supreme Court rejected that request on Monday in its unsigned opinion in the case, Azar v. Garza, No. 17-654.‚The court takes allegations like those the government makes here seriously, for ethical rules are necessary to the maintenance of a culture of civility and mutual trust within the legal profession,‚ the opinion said. ‚On the one hand, all attorneys must remain aware of the principle that zealous advocacy does not displace their obligations as officers of the court.‚‚Especially in fast-paced, emergency proceedings like those at issue here, it is critical that lawyers and courts alike be able to rely on one another‚s representations,‚ the opinion said. ‚On the other hand, lawyers also have ethical obligations to their clients and not all communication breakdowns constitute misconduct.‚But, the opinion concluded, ‚the court need not delve into the factual disputes raised by the parties‚ in order to vacate the appeals court‚s decision.",Supreme Court Rejects Bid to Discipline A.C.L.U.,"May 29, 2018 /  1:36 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-abortion/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-challenge-to-arkansas-abortion-law-idUSW1N1QB00Y,"WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - In a setback to abortion rights advocates, the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday paved the way for Republican-backed restrictions on medication-induced abortions to take effect in Arkansas that could lead to the shuttering of two of the state’s three abortion clinics. The nine justices declined to hear an appeal by abortion provider Planned Parenthood of a lower court ruling that had revived the state law, which sets regulations regarding the RU-486 “abortion pill,” after it was earlier struck down by a federal judge.

The court‚s decision was narrow, and it left open the larger question of whether a business can discriminate against gay men and lesbians based on rights protected by the First Amendment.The court passed on an opportunity to either bolster the right to same-sex marriage or explain how far the government can go in regulating businesses run on religious principles. Instead, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy‚s majority opinion turned on the argument that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which originally ruled against the baker, had been shown to be hostile to religion because of the remarks of one of its members.At the same time, Justice Kennedy strongly reaffirmed protections for gay rights.‚The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts,‚ he wrote, ‚all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.‚Justice Kennedy often casts the deciding vote in closely divided cases on major social issues. When the court agreed to hear the Colorado case last June, it seemed to present him with a stark choice between two of his core commitments. On the one hand, Justice Kennedy has written every major Supreme Court decision protecting gay men and lesbians. On the other, he is the court‚s most ardent defender of free speech. On Monday, Justice Kennedy chose a third path, one that seemed to apply only to the case before the court.Writing for the majority in the 7-to-2 decision, he said the Civil Rights Commission‚s ruling against the baker, Jack Phillips, had been infected by religious animus. He cited what he said were ‚inappropriate and dismissive comments‚ from one commissioner in saying that the panel had acted inappropriately and that its decision should be overturned.‚The neutral and respectful consideration to which Phillips was entitled was compromised here,‚ Justice Kennedy wrote. ‚The Civil Rights Commission‚s treatment of his case has some elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs that motivated his objection.‚That passage echoed his plea for tolerance in his majority opinion in 2015 in Obergefell v. Hodges, which recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. In that decision, he called for ‚an open and searching debate‚ between those who opposed same-sex marriage on religious grounds and those who considered such unions ‚proper or indeed essential.‚ When the Colorado case was argued in December, Justice Kennedy seemed frustrated with the main choices available to him and hinted that he was looking for an off ramp. His questions suggested that his vote had not been among the four that had been needed to add the case to the court‚s docket. The breadth of the court‚s majority was a testament to the narrowness of the decision‚s reasoning. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Elena Kagan and Neil M. Gorsuch joined Justice Kennedy‚s majority opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas voted with the majority but would have adopted broader reasons.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented.The case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, No. 16-111, arose from a brief encounter in 2012, when David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited Mr. Phillips‚s bakery, Masterpiece Cakeshop, in Lakewood, Colo. The two men were going to be married in Massachusetts, and they were looking for a wedding cake for a reception in Colorado.Mr. Phillips turned them down, saying he would not use his talents to convey a message of support for same-sex marriage at odds with his religious faith. Mr. Mullins and Mr. Craig said they were humiliated by Mr. Phillips‚s refusal to serve them, and they filed a complaint with Colorado‚s Civil Rights Commission, saying that Mr. Phillips had violated a state law barring discrimination based on sexual orientation.Mr. Mullins and Mr. Craig won before the commission and in the state courts.The Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that Mr. Phillips‚s free speech rights had not been violated, noting that the couple had not discussed the cake‚s design before Mr. Phillips turned them down. The court added that people seeing the cake would not understand Mr. Phillips to be making a statement and that he remained free to say what he liked about same-sex marriage in other settings.Though the case was mostly litigated on free speech grounds, Justice Kennedy‚s opinion barely discussed the issue. Instead, he focused on what he said were flaws in the proceedings before the commission. Members of the panel, he wrote, had acted with ‚clear and impermissible hostility‚ to sincerely held religious beliefs.One commissioner in particular, Justice Kennedy wrote, had crossed the line in saying that ‚freedom of religion and religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust.‚ Justice Kennedy wrote that ‚this sentiment is inappropriate for a commission charged with the solemn responsibility of fair and neutral enforcement of Colorado‚s anti-discrimination law.‚In dissent, Justice Ginsburg said that a few stray remarks were not enough to justify a ruling in Mr. Phillips‚s favor.‚What prejudice infected the determinations of the adjudicators in the case before and after the commission?‚ Justice Ginsburg asked. ‚The court does not say.‚Justice Kennedy wrote that the commission had also acted inconsistently in cases involving an opponent of same-sex marriage, ‚concluding on at least three occasions that a baker acted lawfully in declining to create cakes with decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay marriages.‚ In dueling concurring opinions, two sets of justices debated how central that last observation was to the court‚s decision. Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Breyer, said such differing treatment could be justified. Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Alito, disagreed, saying that ‚the two cases share all legally salient features.‚In another concurring opinion, Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Gorsuch, said he would have ruled in favor of Mr. Phillips on free speech grounds. Mr. Phillips‚s cakes are artistic expression worthy of First Amendment protection, Justice Thomas wrote, and requiring him to endorse marriages at odds with his faith violated his constitutional rights. In dissent, Justice Ginsburg disagreed with that analysis and noted that the majority had not adopted it. She wrote that there was no reason to think that people seeing a wedding cake made by Mr. Phillips would understand it to be conveying his views on same-sex marriage.Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Mr. Phillips, said the ruling was a victory for religious liberty.‚Government hostility toward people of faith has no place in our society, yet the State of Colorado was openly antagonistic toward Jack‚s religious beliefs about marriage,‚ said Kristen Waggoner, a lawyer with the group. ‚The court was right to condemn that. Tolerance and respect for good-faith differences of opinion are essential in a society like ours.‚The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Mr. Mullins and Mr. Craig, said it welcomed the parts of the majority opinion that reaffirmed legal protections for gay men and lesbians.‚The court reversed the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision based on concerns unique to the case but reaffirmed its longstanding rule that states can prevent the harms of discrimination in the marketplace, including against L.G.B.T. people,‚ said Louise Melling, the group‚s deputy legal director.Some gay rights groups took a darker view of the decision. ‚The court today has offered dangerous encouragement to those who would deny civil rights to L.G.B.T. people,‚ said Rachel B. Tiven, the chief executive of Lambda Legal. ‚We will fiercely resist the coming effort that will seek to turn this ruling into a broad license to discriminate.‚Even as she dissented, Justice Ginsburg wrote that ‚there is much in the court‚s opinion with which I agree,‚ quoting several passages reaffirming gay rights protections.‚Colorado law,‚ Justice Kennedy wrote in one, ‚can protect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public.‚","In Narrow Decision, Supreme Court Sides With Baker Who Turned Away Gay Couple","June 5, 2018 /  12:20 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-baker-react/disappointment-and-relief-over-u-s-ruling-on-cake-for-gay-couple-idUSKCN1J1014,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Supporters of LGBT rights greeted with dismay and relief a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Monday in favor of a Christian baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, saying the decision was unlikely to have a sweeping legal impact. FILE PHOTO: Police officers stand in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, DC, U.S., January 19, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File PhotoThe nation’s highest court said the baker’s religious rights were violated when a state Civil Rights Commission decided he had broken Colorado’s anti-discrimination law. The refusal by baker Jack Phillips in 2012 to make a cake for David Mullins and Charlie Craig became a cultural flashpoint, seen as part of a conservative Christian backlash to the Supreme Court’s ruling allowing gay marriage.  President Donald Trump’s administration intervened in support of the baker. But the Supreme Court ruling did not address broader questions of religious exemptions from anti-discrimination laws or whether baking a cake is protected as free speech under the U.S. Constitution, experts said. “The broad rule that the bakery was looking for here was that it had a license to discriminate,” said James Essex, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). “They most emphatically did not get that ruling from this court today.” The decision made it clear that even if the court ultimately rules in a future case that bakers or other businesses that sell creative products such as florists and wedding photographers can avoid punishment under anti-discrimination laws, most businesses open to the public would have no such defense.  Nonetheless, the couple, Mullins and Craig, said they were disappointed. “No one should have to face the shame, embarrassment and humiliation of being told ‘we don’t serve your kind here’ that we faced,” they said on an ACLU conference call with reporters. Annise Parker, head of the LGBTQ Victory Institute, expressed concern it could “open the floodgates” to discrimination. “Homophobic forces will purposefully over-interpret the ruling and challenge existing non-discrimination laws by refusing service to LGBTQ people ... denying them dinner at a restaurant, lodging at a hotel, or renting an apartment,” Parker said in a statement. The Human Rights Coalition echoed the view that the ruling “did not change our nation’s fundamental civil rights laws.” “Regardless of today’s decision, the fact remains that LGBTQ people face alarming levels of discrimination all across the country,” the civil rights group said. Essex added that the issue is “not about cakes.” “It is about access to health care. It’s about access to education. It’s about employment. It’s about people being fired from jobs because their employer has a religious objection to who they are,” he said. The ACLU represented the gay couple. “There is an intentional campaign out there of people who are opposed to LGBT rights but also to equality more broadly,” he said. “I’m sure they are out there saying this is a broad victory.” Colorado Christian University President Donald Sweeting  called it “an enormous milestone victory” for “religious freedom and freedom of conscience.” “We are grateful that the court upheld these today,” he said in a statement.

Colorado Civil Rights Commission, No. 16-111, arose from a brief encounter in 2012, when David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited Mr. Phillips‚s bakery, Masterpiece Cakeshop, in Lakewood, Colo. The two men were going to be married in Massachusetts, and they were looking for a wedding cake for a reception in Colorado.Mr. Phillips turned them down, saying he would not use his talents to convey a message of support for same-sex marriage at odds with his religious faith. Mr. Mullins and Mr. Craig said they were humiliated by Mr. Phillips‚s refusal to serve them, and they filed a complaint with Colorado‚s Civil Rights Commission, saying that Mr. Phillips had violated a state law barring discrimination based on sexual orientation.Mr. Mullins and Mr. Craig won before the commission and in the state courts.The Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that Mr. Phillips‚s free speech rights had not been violated, noting that the couple had not discussed the cake‚s design before Mr. Phillips turned them down. The court added that people seeing the cake would not understand Mr. Phillips to be making a statement and that he remained free to say what he liked about same-sex marriage in other settings.Though the case was mostly litigated on free speech grounds, Justice Kennedy‚s opinion barely discussed the issue.

In dissent, Justice Ginsburg disagreed with that analysis and noted that the majority had not adopted it. She wrote that there was no reason to think that people seeing a wedding cake made by Mr. Phillips would understand it to be conveying his views on same-sex marriage.Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Mr. Phillips, said the ruling was a victory for religious liberty.‚Government hostility toward people of faith has no place in our society, yet the State of Colorado was openly antagonistic toward Jack‚s religious beliefs about marriage,‚ said Kristen Waggoner, a lawyer with the group. ‚The court was right to condemn that.

The justices, in a 7-2 decision, said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission showed an impermissible hostility toward religion when it found that baker Jack Phillips violated the state’s anti-discrimination law by rebuffing gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012. The state law bars businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation. The court concluded that the commission violated Phillips’ religious rights under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. But the justices did not issue a definitive ruling on the circumstances under which people can seek exemptions from anti-discrimination laws based on religion. The decision also did not address important claims raised in the case including whether baking a cake is a kind of expressive act protected by the Constitution’s free speech guarantee. Two of the court’s four liberals, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, joined the five conservative justices in the ruling authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who also wrote the landmark 2015 decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide. The baker case became a cultural flashpoint in the United States, underscoring the tensions between gay rights proponents and conservative Christians. Both sides claimed a measure of victory. The couple’s supporters noted that the ruling embraced the importance of gay rights and made it clear that businesses open to the public must serve everyone. The baker’s lawyers said the ruling emphasized that the government must respect religious beliefs. “It’s hard to believe that the government punished me for operating my business consistent with my beliefs about marriage. That isn’t freedom or tolerance,” Phillips said in a statement. “Today’s decision means our fight against discrimination and unfair treatment will continue,” Mullins and Charlie Craig said in a statement. “We have always believed that in America, you should not be turned away from a business open to the public because of who you are.” Seventy-two percent of U.S. adults believe that businesses should not have the right on religious grounds to deny services to customers based on their sexual orientation, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Monday showed.  “Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth,” Kennedy wrote. But Kennedy said the state commission’s hostility toward religion “was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion.” In one exchange at a 2014 hearing before the commission cited by Kennedy, former commissioner Diann Rice said that “freedom of religion, and religion, has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust.” Kennedy said the commission ruled the opposite way in three cases brought against bakers in which the business owners refused to bake cakes containing messages that demeaned gay people or same-sex marriage.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File PhotoSESSIONS HAILS RULING Republican President Donald Trump’s administration, which intervened in the case in support of Phillips, welcomed the ruling. “The First Amendment prohibits governments from discriminating against citizens on the basis of religious beliefs,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. The decision made it clear that even if the court ultimately rules in a future case that bakers or other businesses that sell creative products such as florists and wedding photographers can avoid punishment under anti-discrimination laws, most businesses open to the public would have no such defense. Of the 50 states, 21 including Colorado have anti-discrimination laws protecting gay people.  The case marked a test for Kennedy, who has authored significant rulings that advanced gay rights but also is a strong advocate for free speech rights and religious freedom. “The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market,” Kennedy wrote. In a written dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by fellow liberal Sonia Sotomayor, said what mattered was that Phillips would not provide a good or service to a same-sex couple that he would provide to a heterosexual couple. The litigation, along with similar cases around the country, was part of a conservative Christian backlash to the Supreme Court’s gay marriage ruling. Mullins and Craig were planning their wedding in Massachusetts in 2012 and wanted the cake for a reception in Colorado, where gay marriage was not yet legal. During a brief encounter at Phillips’ Masterpiece Cakeshop in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, the baker politely but firmly refused, leaving the couple distraught. They filed a successful complaint with the state commission and state courts sided with the couple, prompting Phillips to appeal to the top U.S. court. Mullins and Craig said Phillips was using his Christian faith as pretext for unlawful discrimination based on sexual orientation. Phillips and others like him who believe that gay marriage is inconsistent with their Christian beliefs have said they should not be required to effectively endorse the practice. “Government hostility toward people of faith has no place in our society, yet the state of Colorado was openly antagonistic toward Jack’s religious beliefs about marriage. The court was right to condemn that,” said lawyer Kristen Waggoner of the conservative Christian group Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Phillips.

The court‚s decision was narrow, and it left open the larger question of whether a business can discriminate against gay men and lesbians based on rights protected by the First Amendment.The court passed on an opportunity to either bolster the right to same-sex marriage or explain how far the government can go in regulating businesses run on religious principles. Instead, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy‚s majority opinion turned on the argument that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which originally ruled against the baker, had been shown to be hostile to religion because of the remarks of one of its members.At the same time, Justice Kennedy strongly reaffirmed protections for gay rights.‚The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts,‚ he wrote, ‚all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.‚Justice Kennedy often casts the deciding vote in closely divided cases on major social issues. When the court agreed to hear the Colorado case last June, it seemed to present him with a stark choice between two of his core commitments. On the one hand, Justice Kennedy has written every major Supreme Court decision protecting gay men and lesbians. On the other, he is the court‚s most ardent defender of free speech. On Monday, Justice Kennedy chose a third path, one that seemed to apply only to the case before the court.Writing for the majority in the 7-to-2 decision, he said the Civil Rights Commission‚s ruling against the baker, Jack Phillips, had been infected by religious animus. He cited what he said were ‚inappropriate and dismissive comments‚ from one commissioner in saying that the panel had acted inappropriately and that its decision should be overturned.‚The neutral and respectful consideration to which Phillips was entitled was compromised here,‚ Justice Kennedy wrote. ‚The Civil Rights Commission‚s treatment of his case has some elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs that motivated his objection.‚That passage echoed his plea for tolerance in his majority opinion in 2015 in Obergefell v.

Until now.A study released Monday by Unicef shows that Afghanistan‚s out-of-school population has risen to 3.7 million, or 44 percent of the school-age population, compared with 3.5 million, or 40 percent of the school-age population, a few years ago.It was the first time the number of out-of-school children in Afghanistan had risen since the ouster of the Taliban government by the American-led invasion in 2001. Under the Taliban, many schools were closed and girls were barred from attending.The resumption of the provision of basic education in Afghanistan and the inclusion of girls have been regarded as a relative success story in the country. ‚We‚re very concerned we‚ve lost these hard-won gains, and that‚s very frustrating in the humanitarian and development world,‚ Unicef‚s executive director, Henrietta H. Fore, said. ‚If girls and boys stay out of school, it becomes very difficult to get them back into school.‚A summary of the study on the Unicef website said, ‚The ongoing conflict and worsening security situation across the country ‚ combined with deeply ingrained poverty and discrimination against girls ‚ have pushed the rate of out-of-school children up for the first time since 2002 levels.‚Girls account for 60 percent of the out-of-school population, the study said, and in the worst-affected provinces ‚ Kandahar, Helmand, Wardak, Paktika, Zabul and Oruzgan ‚ up to 85 percent of girls who should be in school were not attending.The study attributed the change, particularly for girls, partly to family displacements caused by the war and the enduring practice of child marriages.It also said shortages of female teachers, poor school facilities and the basic dangers of going to school in conflict zones ‚are also factors driving children ‚ particularly girls ‚ away from the classroom.‚ The study did find that among the Afghan children enrolled in school, dropout rates were relatively low. Eighty-five percent of boys and girls who start primary school complete the last grade, while 94 percent of boys and 90 percent of girls who start secondary school complete the grades.‚The challenge is to get children to start school in the first place,‚ Unicef said.","More Afghan Children Are Out of School, Reversing a Trend","June 3, 2018 /  6:43 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-children/nearly-half-afghan-children-out-of-school-number-rising-for-first-time-in-years-idUSKCN1IZ075,"KABUL (Reuters) - Nearly half all children in Afghanistan are out of school due to conflict, poverty, child marriage and discrimination against girls, the number rising for the first time since 2002, humanitarian organizations said in a report on Sunday. Spreading violence has forced many schools to close, undermining fragile gains in education for girls in a country where millions have never set foot in a class room. Some 3.7 million children between the ages of seven and 17, or 44 percent, are out of school, 2.7 million of them girls, Education Minister Mirwais Balkhi told a seminar, explaining a study conducted by UNICEF, USAID and the independent Samuel Hall think-tank. The Taliban, seeking to oust the U.S.-backed government and return the country to strict Islamic rule after their 2001 ouster, are adamantly opposed to education for girls and threats from Islamic State have forced the closure of dozens of schools. Without mentioning the Taliban or Islamic State, Balkhi said there were “many reasons” for children not going to school. “Education of children is the most important development in all human communities,” he said. “It is the most important tool in fighting war, poverty and unemployment.” In the worst affected provinces, up to 85 percent of girls are not going to school, the aid groups said. They did not give specific time periods or comparisons. In April this year, militants set ablaze two schools and widespread violence had led to closure of hundreds of private schools.   “Business as usual is not an option for Afghanistan if we are to fulfil the right to education for every child,” said Adele Khodr of UNICEF in the report. “When children are not in school, they are at increased danger of abuse, exploitation and recruitment.” One teenage girl, Ziwar, from central Daikundi, one of the safest provinces in the country, said she had been at school until she was 14. “I can read and write. I can write a letter,” she told seminar delegates. “I learn from books. I want to continue my studies. I want to become a doctor in the future.” In Mazar-i-Sharif, capital of the northern province of Balkh, one girl was killed and 20 were injured in a stampede at a school as they rushed to collect their university entrance exam passes on Sunday.

Among those he can thank is Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, who campaigned at his side and darkly warned that the election was about ‚the survival of the Slovenian nation.‚Mr. Orban has become a right-wing hero with his blunt attacks against liberal democracy. Yet if his support was important, so, too, was the help of Mr. Orban‚s friends.In the past two years, Hungarian businessmen close to Mr. Orban have quietly invested in, or started, a handful of right-wing media outlets in Slovenia and in Macedonia. One, Skandal24, a sensationalist gossip magazine, took aim at some of Mr. Jansa‚s opponents with salacious, thinly sourced articles. Another, the television channel Nova24TV, ran alarmist reports about migrants ‚ and also got an ‚exclusive‚ interview with Mr. Orban in May.‚Jansa is exactly the kind of leader Slovenia needs,‚ Mr. Orban told Nova24TV.As they gather strength across Europe, populist parties are proving adept at manipulating the media to push their messages and attack mainstream parties. In Italy, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement is now part of a new coalition government, despite being accused of using a misinformation campaign to discredit opponents. In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party has long used its television channel, FP√ñ TV, to spread its message and build its base. In consolidating power in Hungary, Mr. Orban has recognized the huge power of media and now seems intent on trying to expand his sphere of influence. Last year, one of his closest advisers, Arpad Habony, met with Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump‚s former chief strategist, in Washington. The purpose of the visit, according to a person familiar with the meeting, was to discuss starting an outlet in Eastern Europe like Breitbart News, a platform often used to promote hard-edge nationalist ideas.Inside Hungary, Mr. Orban‚s allies control much of the domestic media and use their outlets to push his anti-immigrant, nativist message. During the recent Hungarian election campaign, the pro-Orban media bombarded voters with sensationalist articles about the threat of a coming immigrant horde ‚ even though immigration has slowed to a trickle. Friendly outlets routinely portrayed Mr. Orban as the defender of a nation under siege from decadent Western beliefs.By investing in Slovenian media ‚ even if only in a handful of outlets like Skandal24 ‚ Mr. Orban‚s allies effectively give him a voice in a neighboring country, which they used to support Mr. Jansa. It is still too soon to know whether Mr. Jansa will be able to piece together a governing coalition in Slovenia. But if he does, one beneficiary would be Mr. Orban, who would have a potential ally inside the European Union at a moment when the bloc‚s leadership is contemplating funding cuts for Hungary.‚Orban obviously wants someone like Janez Jansa as prime minister of Slovenia,‚ said Danilo Turk, a former United Nations official who was Slovenia‚s president from 2007 to 2012. ‚If Orban had a person on the same wavelength in Slovenia, that would only add to his influence in Europe.‚ The majority owner of Skandal24 is Peter Schatz, a Hungarian businessman from Mr. Orban‚s circle. There is no evidence that Mr. Orban is dictating the magazine‚s editorial line, but there is little question that Mr. Schatz is clearly aligned with the Hungarian leader. Once a low-profile executive at Hungarian state television, Mr. Schatz emerged in 2015 as the co-owner of Ripost, a pro-Orban newspaper that depends heavily on the Orban government. From January to November of 2016, nearly 97 percent of its advertising revenue came from the government, according to financial documents leaked to the Hungarian investigative portal Index.hu and shared with The New York Times.As he gained influence in Hungary, Mr. Schatz moved into Slovenia, and then into Macedonia. In September 2016, Ripost bought a 15.1 percent stake in Nova24TV, a Slovenian television company and news website founded by supporters of Mr. Jansa‚s party, the Slovenian Democratic Party. On the same day, two other companies ‚ including one co-owned by Mr. Habony, the Orban adviser ‚ bought near-identical shares.Those investments in Nova24TV turned out to be coordinated: Bank documents obtained independently by The Times, and first published by Mladina, a Slovenian political magazine, showed that all three had been funded by Karoly Varga, a Hungarian construction mogul who has won a disproportionate number of state contracts during Mr. Orban‚s tenure.In June 2017, Mr. Schatz bought a majority stake in a second Slovenian media company, New Horizon, which publishes a right-wing weekly magazine, Demokracija. The purchase turned him into a formal partner of the Slovenian Democratic Party, which remains the company‚s minority owner. A month later, Mr. Schatz ‚ through New Horizon ‚ agreed to lend 60,000 euros, or nearly $70,000, to the party itself, according to Zoran Mladenovic, the supreme state auditor at the Slovenian Court of Audit, who oversees scrutiny of political party finances.Because New Horizon is not a financial institution, the loan was deemed illegal by the Court of Audit, which has referred a decision on possible fines to a district court.‚It is unusual in the first place that a political party would acquire a loan from a company that is not allowed to give loans,‚ Mr. Mladenovic said. A few weeks later, Mr. Schatz ‚ again through New Horizon ‚ started Skandal24, which quickly set its sights on leftist politicians and the centrist prime minister, Miro Cerar. One article attacked him for claiming reimbursement for travel expenses while on official business. The following week, the magazine splashed a thinly sourced article about a left-wing politician‚s love life across two pages.Last summer, Mr. Schatz also took control of Alfa TV, a right-wing television station in Macedonia that has long supported Nikola Gruevski, the former prime minister who is Mr. Orban‚s closest ally in the country. Mr. Schatz now has a majority stake in the broadcaster, according to research by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, an international network of investigative journalists. During the same period, a former colleague of Mr. Schatz at Hungarian state television, Agnes Adamik, also bought a series of right-wing online outlets in Macedonia. (Ms. Adamik did not respond to requests for comment.) ‚They are investing in a new kind of political alliance,‚ said Sandra Basic-Hrvatin, a media researcher at the University of Primorska, and a former member of an independent commission that advised the Slovenian Culture Ministry on media policy. ‚They‚re investing in a media empire to influence elections and to build up a new political force in the E.U.,‚ added Professor Basic-Hrvatin, who has herself been targeted by Mr. Schatz‚s outlets because of her criticism.Mr. Schatz, Nova24TV, Demokracija, the Slovenian Democratic Party and Mr. Orban‚s spokesman all declined to comment. The editor of Skandal24, Marjanca Scheicher, hid behind a door when a Times reporter made an unannounced visit to the shared offices of Skandal24, Nova24TV, and Demokracija. Miro Petek, a spokesman for the Slovenian Democratic Party, later wrote a column for Nova24TV criticizing the tone of the reporter‚s emails and his focus on outlets linked to the party.If Mr. Jansa is able to form a governing coalition, media freedom is likely to re-emerge as an issue in Slovenia. In his first turn as prime minister, Mr. Jansa, a former dissident and columnist during the communist era, started a crackdown on the country‚s established news outlets, accusing journalists of bias and claiming that they had catered to the interests of the political elite, including many who were part of the former communist government.Slovenian regulators are currently looking at the issue of foreign media ownership, most notably a planned takeover of the country‚s main private television network by a regional telecommunications giant that is majority-owned by an American investment firm. Supporters of Mr. Jansa say this deal has far greater implications for Slovenian media than the ownership of smaller outlets like Skandal24 and Nova24TV. Ziga Turk, a former cabinet minister for the Slovenian Democratic Party, said the Hungarian investment in right-wing Slovenian outlets had helped balance what he described as a media landscape skewed against right-wing parties.‚It‚s positive for pluralism because these voices, and also the audiences of these voices, would not otherwise have a media to rely on,‚ said Mr. Turk, who oversaw the regulation of Slovenian media from 2011 to 2013.He added that Mr. Schatz‚s outlets had only a ‚marginal‚ influence, with a reach that is ‚not like Fox News.‚Media experts in the region say Mr. Schatz‚s purchases are not likely to drastically change the balance of voices in countries like Slovenia and Macedonia. Yet Mr. Schatz‚s involvement has reinvigorated two outlets friendly to the far right, and allowed for the creation of a third, Skandal24.‚These are not huge investments, but they‚re important because other political parties don‚t have this kind of media,‚ said Marko Milosavljevic, a media researcher at the University of Ljubljana. ‚These outlets can play a big role. They can help set the agenda ‚ because other media have to report what these outlets are saying.‚And they represent a signal of intent from Mr. Orban.‚Formally speaking, it is not the Hungarian state that is making these investments,‚ said Milan Kucan, who was president for the first 11 years of Slovenia‚s independence. ‚Formally, these are just Hungarian businessmen. But in reality they act as the long arm of Orban.‚","Safe in Hungary, Viktor Orban Pushes His Message Across Europe","May 25, 2018 /  8:06 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-orban/hungary-will-defend-traditional-families-stop-demographic-decline-orban-says-idUSKCN1IQ0V8,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary’s government will launch measures to stop and then reverse a demographic decline by 2030, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday, as he blamed liberal democracy for undermining traditional families. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban adjusts his tie before addressing parliament in Budapest Hungary, May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo/File PhotoOrban said the key question was whether the Hungarian nation was preserved “biologically and in numbers” and what the government should do to stop the demographic decline. He said the government would launch a “serious family policy action plan” but did not go into detail. Liberal democracy had failed to halt immigration, protect Christian culture or strengthen the traditional family of one man and one woman, Orban said. “There are many kinds of families, many ways of life and it (liberal democracy) says we should not differentiate between these ... it wants to ensure equal treatment in the law ... and this is the reason, this is one of the reasons, why we are experiencing a demographic decline now,” Orban told state radio. Statistical data show that Hungary’s population has been declining for decades. Since Orban was elected in 2010, it has declined further, to 9.771 million in January 2018 from 10.014 million in 2010.       He said the period until 2030 in Hungary and Europe should be defined by a modernized concept of Christian democracy instead. “Christian democracy protects us from migration, defends the borders, supports the traditional family model of one man, one woman, considers the protection of our Christian culture as a natural thing,” he said. Orban, 54, took power in 2010 and has continually increased his control over the media, put allies in charge of once-independent institutions and campaigned on a platform of fierce hostility to immigration. His policies have put him into conflict with the European Union, but he was re-elected for a third straight term last month. A vehement opponent of immigration into Europe by Muslim refugees from the Middle East and Africa, Orban’s campaign - helped by his party’s media dominance - resonated with swathes of the electorate. His Fidesz party now holds 133 of 199 seats in parliament. Orban reiterated his government will submit legislation to parliament next week that would impose criminal penalties on non-governmental groups accused of helping and financing illegal immigration. “We must sanction those ... who conduct such activities,” Orban told state radio.

A regulatory ruling on Tuesday could be a prelude to a bidding war over the company ‚ and to a larger fight over 21st Century Fox.The deal-making machinations, which have unfolded in two countries for over a year, are complicated and interconnected. Disney has offered to buy Fox, which already owns part of Sky and has offered to buy the rest. Comcast has made plays for both Fox and Sky, all with the goal of causing trouble for Disney.Fox‚s bid for Sky had been held up in regulatory limbo in Britain for months over concerns that it would give Fox‚s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, too much control over the country‚s media. On Tuesday, Britain‚s culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, ruled that Fox could proceed with its bid, provided that it sold Sky News, the broadcaster‚s 24-hour news channel. In December 2016, Fox offered 18.5 billion pounds, or about $25 billion, for the piece of Sky it did not already own. Comcast countered in April with a $29 billion bid. Given the ruling on Tuesday, Comcast is expected to continue its quest to buy Sky, forcing Mr. Murdoch and Disney to pay up if they want to win.The complexity of the maneuvering underscores the shifting state of the media business. As consumers do more of their viewing online, Amazon, Netflix and other streaming services are shaking up the industry. And as the traditional players try to compete, they have decided on a collective response: making deals.In December, Disney agreed to buy most of Fox, including its Sky stake, the movie studio 20th Century Fox and the Indian broadcaster Star. Comcast is expected to decide within weeks whether it will challenge that deal directlyHovering over Comcast‚s deliberations is an antitrust ruling in another media-related deal: AT&T‚s $85.4 billion offer for Time Warner. Fox cut off earlier talks with Comcast over antitrust concerns. A favorable ruling for AT&T could give Comcast a way back in.Sky would play an important role in the future of either Disney and Comcast. Based in London, the broadcaster and internet service provider has 23 million customers in five countries, and it owns valuable broadcasting rights to English Premier League games, Formula One races and other sporting events. It also produces its own entertainment programs and has a streaming service, Now TV. The combination makes Sky the kind of one-stop shop that Comcast and Disney want to be. Robert A. Iger, Disney‚s chief executive, has called the satellite broadcaster a ‚crown jewel.‚ Comcast views it as a steppingstone in its own plans to expand beyond the United States.(Mr. Hancock, the British regulator, said that a Comcast bid for Sky would be probably not raise regulatory issues, given the American cable giant‚s limited presence in Britain.)Mr. Murdoch has long coveted regaining control of Sky, which he founded in 1989. He tried once before to buy out other investors in the company, in 2010, but was forced to withdraw amid a furor over a phone-hacking scandal involving his British tabloid empire.When Fox made its bid for Sky in 2016, regulators were again wary. Mr. Murdoch and his family are divisive figures in Britain, controlling not only Sky but also News Corp, which runs some of the country‚s most popular newspapers. Lawmakers and regulators have openly questioned whether the Murdochs should have so much sway over British news outlets.Fox has sought to assuage those concerns, promising to maintain the editorial independence of Sky‚s news arm. Ultimately, Mr. Hancock, the culture secretary, insisted that Sky News be sold to protect its integrity. He told Parliament on Tuesday that the news operation could be sold to Disney, as Fox has proposed, or to another buyer, as long as it remained financially viable.But Mr. Hancock said that if Fox could not reach a deal for Sky News that the government would approve, he would be forced to block its bid, adding, ‚This is not my preferred approach.‚Fox, which has waited 16 months for government clearance for its bid, said it welcomed Mr. Hancock‚s decision. The company added, ‚We are confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction.‚ What is most likely to come next are internal deliberations within Fox and Disney about how much to raise their offer for Sky. Shares in the British broadcaster have jumped 22 percent since February, when Comcast announced its plans to challenge Fox‚s bid.Sky, which withdrew its support for Fox‚s bid once Comcast made a formal takeover offer, said in its own statement on Tuesday that its independent directors would focus on what would fetch the most value for shareholders.",U.K. Clears Way for Bidding War Between Comcast and Disney Over Sky,"June 5, 2018 /  1:14 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/fox-ma-sky-britain/britain-clears-fox-bid-for-sky-if-it-sells-sky-news-idUSL9N1R1026,"LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Britain cleared Rupert Murdoch’s bid to buy Sky on Tuesday so long as Sky News is sold, paving the way for the mogul’s Twenty-First Century Fox to go head-to-head with rival Comcast Corp for the European pay-TV group.

Cathy, in May 2017 at Mr. Pruitt‚s behest to set up a meeting.After a back-and-forth in which Ms. Hupp initially said the administrator ‚didn‚t mention a specific topic‚ of discussion, she told the company‚s director of regulatory affairs that Mr. Pruitt‚s request was of a personal nature. ‚The Administrator would like to talk about a potential business opportunity with Mr. Cathy. Nothing very pressing, just hoping to connect sometime in the next month or so,‚ Ms. Hupp wrote.Mr. Pruitt ultimately spoke by phone with Chick-fil-A representatives.Mr. Cathy, reached by phone, referred questions to a company spokeswoman, Carrie Kurlander. Ms. Kurlander said she would not comment further. In an email to The Washington Post, which first reported Mr. Pruitt‚s effort to seek a business deal with Chick-fil-A, Ms. Kurlander had said the call was about the possibility of Mr. Pruitt‚s wife, Marlyn, opening a franchise of the fast food chain. Ms. Kurlander told the Post that Mrs. Pruitt never completed the franchisee application. Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., did not respond to a request for comment.Michael Brune, the Sierra Club‚s executive director, said in a statement that Mr. Pruitt had been engaged in ‚unethically and illegally seeking personal benefits because of the job Donald Trump has entrusted him with.‚The revelation that Mr. Pruitt asked an E.P.A. employee to help coordinate efforts to seek a personal business opportunity comes amid a wave of investigations into the administrator‚s spending and management decisions including his first-class travel and spending on security, as well as his decision last year to accept a $50-a-night lease on a condominium from the wife of a lobbyist with business before his agency. Currently Mr. Pruitt faces 12 federal investigations.It also comes on the heels of a transcript released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, one of the bodies investigating Mr. Pruitt, showing that he tasked Ms. Hupp‚s sister, Millan Hupp, with personal errands including procuring a used mattress from the Trump International Hotel in Washington.In addition, Millan Hupp, who currently serves as Mr. Pruitt‚s scheduler, arranged personal travel for the administrator, including to the Rose Bowl game in California. She also went apartment hunting for him when he was moving out of the lobbyist‚s condo on Capitol Hill. Federal ethics standards prohibit such personal assistance by a subordinate, even if the employee is working outside of office hours.The news prompted outrage from Democrats on Capitol Hill as well as some Republicans. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has been Mr. Pruitt‚s longtime political patron, told CBS News that if the details proved to be accurate, ‚it would not be a good thing.‚ Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday she had not spoken with President Trump about Mr. Pruitt‚s dealings with Chick-fil-A. ‚We continue to have concerns and look into those, and we‚ll address them,‚ she said of the earlier ethics questions that have been raised about Mr. Pruitt‚s oversight of the agency.Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, said if Mr. Pruitt used the power of his office to seek a personal benefit for his wife, that could be a crime. But because Mrs. Pruitt apparently did not follow through with the venture, it might not be prosecuted as such, he said.Having a subordinate like Millan Hupp perform personal duties, paid or unpaid, violates civil statutes, Mr. Noble said. ‚The problem with it is, when you are somebody‚s superior there‚s always the danger of coercion,‚ he said. ‚You don‚t have them wash your car. You don‚t have them walk your dog. And you don‚t have them try to buy a used mattress from a hotel.‚",Scott Pruitt Sought ‚ÄòBusiness Opportunity‚Äô With Chick-fil-A While Leading E.P.A.,"June 14, 2018 /  12:33 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-pruitt/senate-republicans-call-for-hearing-on-pruitt-scandals-idUSKBN1JA01L,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators on Wednesday said embattled Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt should testify before the U.S. Congress to address the list of ethics scandals he faces, but stopped short of calling for his resignation.

REUTERS/Al Drago/File PhotoPruitt came under fire earlier on Wednesday after a report by the Washington Post alleged that the EPA administrator tasked one of his aides and sought help from Republican political donors to find his wife a job. The report prompted Fox News television and radio host Laura Ingraham to call on Pruitt to resign. She is one of the most prominent Conservative voices to call for his resignation. The EPA chief has been under scrutiny the last few months amid reports involving questionable spending on travel and use of security detail, connections with lobbyists and industry groups and use of his office for favors. Pruitt currently faces a dozen investigations by the Office of the Inspector General, Congress and the White House. An EPA spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. President Donald Trump has so far defended Pruitt and praised him for carrying out his policies despite the barrage of negative media reports. On Ingraham’s radio show on Wednesday, fellow Oklahoman and Pruitt ally Republican Senator James Inhofe stopped short of calling for his resignation but said if the stream of scandals does not stop, he would be forced to ask him to step down. “I think something needs to happen to change that,” he told Ingraham. “One of those alternatives would be for him to leave that job.” A spokeswoman for Inhofe later told Reuters that while the senator is not ready to call for resignation, “he has concerns about the reports coming out and wants to hear directly from Pruitt” in a hearing. Other Senate Republicans have started to call for more action against the administrator in recent days. “I support Sen. @JimInhofe’s call for a hearing on EPA Administrator Pruitt’s scandals; and I continue to urge the President to take a hard look at Mr. Pruitt’s actions – as I do not feel that Mr. Pruitt is serving @RealDonaldTrump’s best interests,” Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, chair of the Senate environment committee that has oversight of the EPA, said that he plans to call Pruitt to testify before his panel about his scandals later this year, his spokesman Mike Danylak said. Barrasso also sent a letter this week to Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the appropriations committee for Interior and Environment, to request that there be sufficient funding for the EPA’s Inspector General’s office to carry out several open investigations into Pruitt’s conduct. “The Office of Inspector General has not only expanded a number of ongoing reviews, but has also initiated additional reviews concerning a wide range of allegations related to the Office of the Administrator,” his letter said.

Her father cooked, her mother oversaw the dining room, and Maguy Le Coze was waiting tables by the time she was 12, a serious child who forever remained that way.The two children attended separate elementary schools in Port Navalo ‚ Gilbert the one for boys, Maguy the one for girls. There was another difference: ‚I would do my homework,‚ she said. ‚My brother never did his. I always tried to do the right thing, to learn.‚Her career path, as a woman born into an unassuming French restaurant family, seemed predestined: tending to customers while her man cooked for them. The chef, even behind kitchen doors, was the face of the restaurant. The dutiful woman rarely looked beyond the front door.For Ms. Le Coze, such an existence was understandable but unacceptable. ‚They were good parents,‚ she said. ‚They thought this was the right way to bring us up.‚ She has been working in restaurants for more than 60 years, and what might have been a life spent in a simple family business never occurred. She is today the co-owner of Le Bernardin, the Midtown Manhattan citadel of seafood created by her and her brother, its first chef, and heaped with accolades: three stars from Michelin, four from The New York Times, ratings attained and never lost. Secure in her position and her accomplishments, she is hesitant only to admit her age, worried about the reaction of the staff. ‚When they see I am 73, they will say the boss is old,‚ Ms. Le Coze said.They will not, of course, say anything of the sort, not to a woman so regal, so formidable, so unbending ‚ and so charming when she chooses to be. If Eric Ripert, the chef and other owner of Le Bernardin, is the face of the restaurant and its ambassador, she is its queen. Decades ago her role was to pamper guests; these days she is more often laboring over ledgers in the underground offices.Mr. Ripert calls her ‚the soul, the spirit and‚ ‚ he smiled ‚ ‚the boss of Le Bernardin.‚Yet Ms. Le Coze‚s name is not widely known, except among her peers. Mr. Ripert calls her ‚the most underrated, ultrasuccessful woman in the restaurant world.‚ Amanda Cohen, the chef and owner of Dirt Candy, a vegetarian restaurant on the Lower East Side, said she finds it fascinating that ‚so many of the people who do the hard work behind the scenes are women,‚ mentioning the late Ella Brennan (the New Orleans doyenne who championed Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse) and Barbara Lazaroff (the business partner and ex-wife of Wolfgang Puck). Ms. Cohen pointed out that Gilbert Le Coze, who died in 1994, and Eric Ripert have Wikipedia pages, but Ms. Le Coze does not.Those who cook become stars. Those who toil at other tasks in restaurants rarely have such luck. ‚Many of my friends say to me, ‚Look at what you have done.‚‚ Ms. Le Coze said, uncharacteristically at rest on a patio overlooking the Caribbean Sea outside her sprawling home on the private island of Mustique. ‚I have the same answer: ‚I worked. That‚s it.‚‚If fame has eluded her, the rewards of her success have been numerous: a L√©gion d‚honneur from France, the home on Mustique, apartments in New York and Paris, the house where she grew up in Brittany.She has purposefully forgone much that others prize. She never married and never desired children, preferring romantic relationships that lasted no more than four or five years. She recently took a two-week road trip through the United States with her current boyfriend, and returned enamored of the Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo, Tex. Unexpected, indeed, for a woman with a polished palate, but not the most unusual aspect of the relationship.She met this boyfriend 35 years ago in Saint-Tropez, but had no further contact until he phoned her at Le Bernardin 10 years ago. She wasn‚t there. They met shortly afterward for dinner in Paris. She didn‚t see him for another two years, when they happened to be waiting at adjoining gates at Newark Liberty International Airport. They reconnected. Who says flying has lost its romance?‚My life has been strange,‚ Ms. Le Coze allowed. When she was 15 and brought boyfriends home to meet her parents, ‚I told them I have a boyfriend and that‚s it. At 18 I said to them, ‚I will not get married, I will not have children, I will have lovers.‚ My parents thought they had a very unusual daughter.‚ The reason, she says, was the infidelities of the men in her life: ‚My father cheated on my mother. My brother had so many women.‚Her lifelong passion, it would seem, was none of the men in her life, but her beloved restaurant.She thinks it‚s more than that. ‚It is not possible to have passion for 30 or 40 years,‚ she said. ‚That is something you have for four or five years. It is the same with the restaurant as it is with a man you meet. After passion comes love.‚‚She Sees Everything‚She never aspired to be a cook, and could not have become one even if that had been her dream. ‚I am a disaster,‚ she said. ‚The only thing I can do is steam vegetables.‚Ms. Le Coze was, in the early years of Le Bernardin, a constant and striking presence in the dining room, poised and perfect, attired in Chanel outfits, earrings, bracelets and necklaces. She daringly broke with the prescribed dining room etiquette of the era by perching on the arm of a chair across from her customers, extolling sea-urchin butter poured over raw sea urchins, or sea scallops still alive in their shell, awaiting the stove.These days she prefers to remain in the background. She is primarily the financial overseer of the restaurant and, as always, remains obsessed with orderliness and quality control. She often works from her home office on Mustique, but when she is in New York she is known to spend 18 hours a day at her desk.Mandy Oser, the owner of Ardesia Wine Bar in Hell‚s Kitchen, worked with her at Le Bernardin for nine years. ‚I think about Maguy often when I think about how to run my business,‚ she said. ‚I absorbed everything: Look over profit-and-loss statements. Know how much you spend on napkins. Get your hands dirty with unsexy details.‚ Ms. Le Coze said running a restaurant is two-thirds about business, one-third about the kitchen. Then she reconsidered, conceding that the kitchen of a culinary landmark like Le Bernardin deserves more credit. Surprisingly, Mr. Ripert agreed with this uneven division: ‚I‚d say it‚s 60-40, and she gets the 60. An expensive restaurant is very complex to run. If it is only about the food, you can go to a food truck.‚ Having said that, Mr. Ripert happily proceeded to catalog his partner‚s idiosyncrasies. He walked around the conference room of Le Bernardin, pointing out untidy piles of books, guides and plaques that had accumulated while she was in Mustique.He shook his head. ‚I guarantee this is not going to fly,‚ he said. ‚She‚s very particular about how she wants Le Bernardin to be run. When she‚s been traveling for a week, she comes into the office, looks for shoes under desks, plastic knives and forks in drawers. It drives her crazy. She‚s very neat. Everything has to be a certain way.‚Somewhat in admiration but more in wonder, he praised her uncanny ability to stumble upon the unseemly or inappropriate. ‚She sees everything,‚ he said. ‚Basically, she has a sixth sense. If we are at a meeting, looking at a contract, she for some reason will open to the right page, see when something is wrong. If there is a mistake, she finds it.‚If she is eating, she will always choose the dish that is not the best. Bingo, she orders it. If she goes into the bathroom, it will be right after a client throws paper on the floor. She always arrives at the moment when something is wrong. I don‚t know how she does it.‚ Ms. Le Coze is also a woman of rigorous self-discipline, dedicated to physical fitness. She keeps dumbbells in her office on Mustique, and works out every day, there or in a local gym. She walks daily for at least an hour, except in New York, where she never has enough time, so she compensates with two-hour strolls through Central Park on spring and summer weekends. She does not suffer the slow-footed gladly. ‚When we walk, I am always slowing to look at things,‚ said one of her best friends, Marianne Tesler, who runs marathons. ‚She walks with determination, says to me, ‚Ahh, you‚re too slow.‚‚Mr. Ripert claims to be a faster walker, but concedes he cannot swim with her. ‚In 10 minutes she is so far ahead I give up and go on the beach,‚ he said. Trying to walk to an airport gate with her is futile: ‚In an airport she walks at the speed of light.‚From the Quai to the PantheonBorn 18 months before her brother, Ms. Le Coze was the boss of an inseparable childhood partnership, until he turned 14 and took over. They left for Paris in 1964, after high school. ‚When I was 21 I had just one thing in mind, having fun,‚ she said. ‚I left Brittany for the life I didn‚t have with my parents.‚In Paris she worked as a model at a fashion house, posing in the latest designs for customers. She was tall enough at 5-foot-7 to become a runway model, but lacked the self-confidence.‚I was beautiful,‚ Ms. Le Coze recalled. ‚but I was too shy to go to the big names in the fashion industry, intending to do the big shows.‚ Gilbert worked for a hairdresser, fetching sandwiches, moving cars and making more money in tips than she made modeling. They returned to Brittany in summers to help their parents operate the hotel. Asked what she learned about business from them, she emphatically replied, ‚Nothing! My brother and I learned nothing from our parents. ‚When we opened our first Le Bernardin in Paris in 1972, we did not even know how to count. We had no education in how to run a restaurant. You do not learn from cooking in the kitchen with your father, as Gilbert did, or working in the dining room with your mother, as I did. After two years, we were almost bankrupt.‚That tiny Le Bernardin, seating 25, was on the same quai as La Tour d‚Argent and named after ‚Les Moines de Saint-Bernardin,‚ a song their father sang to them when they were infants. Mr. Le Coze cooked, aided by a dishwasher. Ms. Le Coze ran the dining room with one waiter. They never locked the wine cellar; residents of the apartments above the restaurant would come by and help themselves.The place received a fine review from Minute, a weekly newspaper with a circulation of 250,000. Believing that this guaranteed success, the Le Cozes started having the fun they had promised themselves. Soon they got a second review, ‚a disaster,‚ she said, from the influential Le Monde.What made it worse, she recalled, was that the critic republished his views under different names in six or seven other newspapers and magazines. The Gault & Millau guide added to the onslaught, awarding them a score of eight out of 20, a devastatingly poor rating. She recalls one line in that review: ‚Send them back to the end of the quai.‚The Le Cozes returned from the fish market one morning and saw a sign on the restaurant window offering the contents for sale: They had failed to pay their taxes, and the government stepped in.‚We used the money we made in the summer working for our parents to pay the taxes, little by little,‚ Ms. Le Coze said. ‚And that‚s when we started to change.‚ Mr. Le Coze redid the menu, his uncomplicated but thoughtful cooking aided by the growing popularity of nouvelle cuisine. A consultant taught Ms. Le Coze how to control costs. They began weighing the fish that arrived from the market rather than simply paying whatever was asked.The two were invited to the apartment of the renowned chef Michel Gu√©rard, who subsequently invited the food critic for L‚Express to join him at Le Bernardin. A review appeared shortly afterward, praising Mr. Le Coze‚s cooking as well as Ms. Le Coze‚s ‚tasteful interior‚ and ‚seductive smile.‚Dancing on the TablesMs. Le Coze claims to have been entirely different during those Paris days ‚ going out to nightclubs, dancing on tables and banquettes. Her lifestyle would have stunned the staff of today‚s Le Bernardin, she said. ‚This is the Maguy you do not know.‚In August, when the restaurant and the rest of Paris closed, she would go to Saint-Tropez while her brother went home to Brittany. She dressed in cowboy boots and short shorts. ‚That was my license one month a year to go crazy,‚ she said. ‚But when I came back to Paris in September and a customer would say to me, ‚We saw you in Saint-Tropez,‚ I would say, ‚No, you must be wrong.‚ When I am back in Paris, I am running the restaurant and I am different.‚Eventually, she and her brother moved Le Bernardin to a bigger space near the Arc de Triomphe and earned two Michelin stars. Yet Ms. Le Coze remained fascinated by the idea of a restaurant in New York, which she had visited twice in the 1970s. ‚To me it was a vision, a spiritual thing, if you believe in those things,‚ she said.In the early 1980s, 10 friends each promised to invest $100,000 in a small restaurant not far from the Lipstick Building in Midtown. Four eventually backed out. Two years after that, she and her brother received an offer from the Equitable insurance company to open a much grander establishment on 51st Street west of Avenue of the Americas, then considered a risky area for a restaurant.Once plans were finalized, Le Bernardin went up in fewer than six months. The feat was made possible by ‚overtime, overtime and more overtime,‚ said her friend Gail George, the wife of the late Philip George, who designed the interior. The restaurant opened in January 1986, and later that year the Le Cozes sold its Paris sibling to the chef Guy Savoy. Three months in, the Le Bernardin in New York received a four-star review from The Times, a rating it maintained even after her brother‚s death in 1994.Mr. Le Coze died in an ambulance of a heart attack suffered while working out at a health club. He was 49.Getting Ms. Le Coze to speak about him is difficult; getting her to express her feelings after his death is impossible. Friends say she never totally recovered from the shock.She recalled, more sad than angry, ‚After Gilbert died, every other restaurant tried to take people from us. They said, ‚She is not here for long.‚‚ Nobody left, and under Mr. Ripert, who took over as chef and several years later became her business partner, the restaurant thrived.From 1994 until Ms. Le Coze redecorated her New York apartment two years ago, the only photographs on display there were of her brother.‚She and Gilbert were like one person,‚ Ms. George said. ‚Maguy was always fussing over him, adored him like I have never seen anyone adore a younger brother. None of Maguy‚s boyfriends back then lasted long. As long as she and Gilbert had each other, they didn‚t need anybody else. She provided the asset of a wife without being a wife.‚ Life in Black and WhiteIn January, this very private woman was drawn into a very public lawsuit filed by a former server at Le Bernardin.The plaintiff alleged that she had been sexually harassed by both the kitchen staff and the wait staff, and that Ms. Le Coze had strongly suggested she lose weight after the birth of her daughter. The litigation came at a time when the restaurant industry has been troubled by a multitude of accusations that employees have been verbally or physically abused.The woman dropped her lawsuit in May; her lawyer said no settlement had been made. Ms. Le Coze would not comment on the suit, citing the advice of her lawyer. She said she barely knew the woman who sued and ‚doesn‚t recall working directly with her.‚‚Why would I be ashamed of a woman being pregnant?‚ she asked. ‚I do not have children, but my friends have children. It is not reasonable that I think like that.‚She said she has never been harassed in a restaurant. ‚Never once, I swear, never.‚ She attributes this to her demeanor, which she describes as, ‚Stop, don‚t go any further, don‚t try.‚At work she is frank, sensible and at times relentless, but she professed not to be overly demanding of her staff, merely confident that she knows what is right and wrong.‚For me, there is black and white,‚ she said. ‚Never gray.

Kristin Avery, a server from September 2012 to July 2015, agreed to drop her lawsuit, though “there has been no settlement or waiver” of any claims, her lawyer, Maimon Kirschenbaum, said in a letter filed in the federal court in Manhattan. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan dismissed the case on Thursday night without prejudice, meaning Avery could bring it again. Kirschenbaum did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Le Bernardin declined to comment. Avery accused Le Bernardin’s general manager of ignoring several complaints by her about harassment by male employees, including when captains allegedly touched her bottom. She also said co-owner Maguy Le Coze shamed her for her pregnancy-related weight gain. Le Coze and chef Eric Ripert, who is also a co-owner, were also defendants in the lawsuit filed Jan. 24, which sought class-action status. Ripert, who was not accused of harassment, in an interview at the time called Avery’s allegations “completely false.” [nL2N1PJ2IF] Le Coze denied the body shaming allegation. Le Bernardin has three Michelin stars and four stars from the New York Times. The lawsuit was filed six weeks after another prominent chef, Mario Batali, stepped away from his businesses after being accused of sexual misconduct.

Bags that had sold for $50 the previous week fetched $300 on June 5, in line with new bags. “Whenever an artist of any kind passes, it’s a common thing that you see both demand for their products increase and average price also increase,” said Kamini Lane, chief marketing officer of the Santa Monica-based company. “But I’ve never seen a jump this significant before.” FILE PHOTO: The outside of a Kate Spade store is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., June 5, 2018.  REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo    The 55-year-old designer, who with her husband built a fashion empire on the popularity of affordable luxury, was found dead in her New York City apartment on Tuesday in an apparent suicide.     Lane recalled that when the high-end couture designer Azzedine Alaia, who dressed stars from Greta Garbo to Grace Jones and Lady Gaga, died last November, the platform saw a spike in the sale of Alaia items, but it was nowhere close to the story of Spade.     “Kate Spade was so accessible to so many people and therefore desired by a broader base,” she said, adding that  after Spade’s death the platform was selling “hundreds of items a day.”     Kate Spade’s brightly colored, clean-lined accessories and bags offered a spunky style to younger working women at a time when luxury handbags were out of reach of most consumers and the industry was dominated by venerable European brands.     Kate and her husband Andy Spade sold their last stake in the Kate Spade accessories brand in 2006 and in 2016 launched a new footwear and accessories brand called Frances Valentine, named after their daughter. Last month high-end handbag maker Tapestry Inc (TPR.N), which bought the Kate Spade brand a year ago, said that sales at established stores were disappointing because of a reduction in discounting of new bags, which cost around $200 to $300. Tapestry was not immediately available for comment.     Online thrift store thredUP said it had sold three times as many Kate Spade items on Tuesday, the day she died, than on Monday. Items with the Kate Spade logo, primarily bags, were most in demand, with users buying more than 3 times as many Kate Spade handbags the day of and day after Spade’s death, when compared against the three month trailing average for Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the company said.

Mr. Weinstein‚s not-guilty plea had been expected. He has steadfastly denied he forced any of the dozens of women who have accused him of sexual misconduct to have sex with him. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said two sexual encounters described in the indictment handed up last week were consensual.‚However reprehensible the crime of rape is, it is equally reprehensive to falsely accuse someone of rape,‚ Mr. Brafman said in court. ‚Mr. Weinstein has denied these allegations. He enjoys the presumption of innocence and vigorously denies these charges. He intends to fight them.‚Once one of the most powerful and admired movie producers in Hollywood, Mr. Weinstein has had a steep fall in the last seven months since The New York Times and The New Yorker published expos√©s in which numerous women accused him of luring them to hotel rooms, ostensibly to talk business, then making unwanted sexual advances.The stories, which won a Pulitzer Prize, became a catalyst for the #MeToo movement and prompted a cascade of revelations about other successful men who have abused their power to sexually harass women in the worlds of media, the arts, sports, haute cuisine and entertainment.More than 80 women, including the actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, have come forward with similar stories about Mr. Weinstein. Some accused him of using physical force to compel them to have sex. Others said he tried to barter parts in movies for sex, or threatened to ruin their careers if they did not comply. Despite investigations in London, Los Angeles and New York, the accounts did not lead to a criminal prosecution, until two weeks ago, when the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., became the first prosecutor to say he had enough evidence to arrest Mr. Weinstein.The lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, handed a copy of indictment to the defense along with a voluntary disclosure report, which lists the evidence against Mr. Weinstein.Mr. Brafman said he intended to challenge the indictment on several grounds, including how it was presented to the grand jury. Justice James M. Burke said he would decide the pretrial motions by Sept. 20, when Mr. Weinstein is scheduled to return to court.Manhattan prosecutors have said they may try to persuade the judge to let them present evidence about past allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein that are not charged in the indictment. This would be done to establish a pattern of behavior, much as prosecutors did to win a conviction against Bill Cosby  at his sexual assault trial in Pennsylvania.But Mr. Brafman said he would fight to keep that evidence out. Under New York case law, it is difficult for prosecutors in the state to introduce evidence at trial about earlier uncharged crimes.The grand jury that handed up the indictment on Wednesday is still hearing from witnesses and could add charges. Prosecutors are also digging into the books of Mr. Weinstein‚s companies, searching for evidence of financial crimes.Investigators continue to interview women who have said Mr. Weinstein forced them to have sex with him. On Monday, for instance, prosecutors met with Melissa Thompson, an entrepreneur who asserted in a lawsuit filed on Friday that Mr. Weinstein overpowered her and raped her during what was supposed to be a sales pitch at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel in September 2011, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an open investigation. Much of Mr. Weinstein‚s half-hour in court was taken up with a discussion of whether Mr. Brafman had a conflict of interest in representing the producer because his former associate, Alex Spiro, had spoken with Ms. Thompson last fall about representing her.Mr. Spiro maintains he left Mr. Brafman‚s firm before Ms. Thompson contacted him. He says he spoke briefly with her on the telephone and then referred her to another lawyer.But Ms. Thompson and her lawyer contend in the lawsuit filed on Friday that Mr. Spiro led her to believe he still worked for Mr. Brafman, and she sent him a videotape of her meeting with Mr. Weinstein, which she said supported her claim.Mr. Brafman told Justice Burke he never communicated with Ms. Thompson and did not know she existed before last week. He said he had no knowledge of her communications with Mr. Spiro and Mr. Spiro ‚never had anything to do with Mr. Weinstein.‚Ms. Illuzzi said the district attorney‚s office did not object to Mr. Brafman continuing to represent Mr. Weinstein as long as Mr. Brafman agreed to forgo cross-examining Ms. Thompson on her communications with Mr. Spiro. She told the judge the prosecution had no current plans to call her.Justice Burke asked Mr. Weinstein if he agreed to waive his right to have his lawyer cross-examine Ms. Thompson on her contacts with Mr. Spiro. ‚Yes,‚ Mr. Weinstein answered.The indictment charges Mr. Weinstein with first-degree and third-degree rape as well as first-degree criminal sexual act, which covers forced oral or anal sex. If Mr. Weinstein is convicted of the top charges, he faces a penalty of five to 25 years in prison.The criminal sex act count stems from an encounter with Lucia Evans, a marketing executive who told investigators that Mr. Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex in 2004 during what she thought would be a casting meeting at the Miramax office in TriBeCa. The victim in the rape case has not been publicly identified. Prosecutors have said she was attacked on March 18, 2013, inside a Doubletree Hotel at 569 Lexington Avenue.",Harvey Weinstein Pleads Not Guilty to Sexual Assault Charges,"May 24, 2018 /  7:47 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/people-harvey-weinstein/update-5-movie-producer-weinstein-to-surrender-on-sex-assault-charges-idUSL2N1SV215,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Film producer Harvey Weinstein was expected to surrender to authorities in New York on Friday, months after he was toppled from Hollywood’s most powerful ranks by scores of women accusing him of sexual assault, a person familiar with the case said. Weinstein’s spokesman Juda Engelmayer and Weinstein’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman both declined to comment. The imminent criminal charging of Weinstein, which was first reported by the New York Daily News, follows a months-long investigation, including by the Manhattan district attorney’s office. A person familiar with the case confirmed the report to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The New York Times and other news outlets also reported Weinstein was expected to surrender. More than 70 women have accused the co-founder of the Miramax studio and The Weinstein Co of sexual misconduct spanning decades, including rape. The allegations, first reported by the New York Times and the New Yorker last year, gave rise to the #MeToo movement in which hundreds of women have publicly accused powerful men in business, government and entertainment. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Weinstein will be charged over an allegation by at least one accuser, Lucia Evans, a former aspiring actress who told the New Yorker that Weinstein forced her to give him oral sex in 2004, the Times and Daily News reported. The exact nature of the charges being brought by Manhattan prosecutors was unclear on Thursday afternoon. The New York Police Department and the district attorney’s office declined to comment on the case. Related CoverageHollywood women applaud impending Harvey Weinstein chargesKEEPING THEIR DISTANCE Entertainment industry heavyweights have distanced themselves from Weinstein, once one of Hollywood’s most powerful men, since the accusations became public. The board of the Weinstein Co fired him and the company itself filed for bankruptcy in March. In 2017, he was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which presents the Oscars.  A former fixture in the most elite entertainment circles of Manhattan and Los Angeles, Weinstein has since been seen spending time in Scottsdale, Arizona, where the New York Times said he had been seeking treatment for sex addiction.  London’s Metropolitan Police have said they are also  investigating an allegation of sexual assault against Weinstein, while prosecutors in Los Angeles said in February they were reviewing three accusations of sexual assault against him. Weinstein’s lawyer Brafman said in a May court filing that federal prosecutors in New York had opened a separate criminal investigation into the allegations.

REUTERS/Steve Crisp/File PhotoActress Ashley Judd last month sued Weinstein, saying that he cost her a part in 1998 for the film “The Lord of the Rings” after she rejected his sexual advances, charges that Weinstein has denied. Actress Rose McGowan, among the first in Hollywood to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault, said in a statement on Thursday that his alleged victims were now “one step closer to justice.” “May this give hope to all victims and survivors everywhere that are telling their truths,” she said. Italian actress Asia Argento, who has accused Weinstein of raping her at the Cannes film festival in 1997 when she was 21, reacted to Thursday’s reports with a one-word Twitter post: “BOOM.”     Other film stars who have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct include Uma Thurman and Salma Hayek.     Brafman, Weinstein’s lawyer, is known for representing high-profile criminal defendants, including pop star Michael Jackson and Martin Shkreli, the former drug company executive.  In 2011, Brafman represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, over charges, which were eventually dropped, that he sexually assaulted a New York City hotel maid.

Crimes for which the statute had not expired on June 23, 2006, were included when the law changed, meaning crimes as early as 2001 can still be prosecuted.  “New York, which used to have some of the shortest state of limitations for rape cases, caught up with the modern world in 2006,” said former Manhattan prosecutor Marc Scholl. “Sex assailants can no longer escape their crimes because victims were afraid to speak.” Reporting by Jonathan Allen, Dan Trotta, Joseph Ax, Karen Freifeld and Peter Szekely in New York and Jill Serjeant in Los Angeles; editing by Grant McCoolOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Movie producer Weinstein to surrender on sex assault charges,Y

On Tuesday afternoon, the small state on the Eastern Seaboard began offering full-scale sports betting, making it the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court‚s decision last month to strike down a 1992 federal law that banned commercial sports betting in most states.In a tweet, Delaware‚s governor, John Carney, a Democrat, announced that he had placed the state‚s first legal single-game bet: $10 on the Philadelphia Phillies, who played the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night. (He won!) Game 3 of the N.B.A. finals on Wednesday night will surely drive plenty of bets.Delaware‚s new operations were introduced at 1:30 p.m. at the state‚s three casinos ‚ Delaware Park, Dover Downs Hotel & Casino and Harrington Raceway & Casino. Gamblers can now place single-game bets on professional baseball, football, hockey, basketball, soccer, golf and auto racing. In-game bets, wagers placed while play is going on, are not permitted. On May 14, the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which largely prohibited sports betting outside of Nevada, saying the law was unconstitutional.‚It is as if federal officers were installed in state legislative chambers and were armed with the authority to stop legislators from voting on any offending proposals,‚ Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said, writing for the majority. ‚A more direct affront to state sovereignty is not easy to imagine.‚With its decision, the Supreme Court opened the door to legalize an estimated $150 billion in illegal wagers on professional and amateur sports that Americans make every year.‚Crushing the illegal market‚ is crucial, Sara Slane, a senior vice president at the American Gaming Association, a trade group that represents casinos, said on Tuesday. ‚Delaware being the first mover certainly puts more pressure on other states to compete.‚ The state was able to move so swiftly because it had been preparing for the possibility of the Supreme Court ruling for six months, Rick Geisenberger, Delaware‚s secretary of finance, said in a news conference at Dover Downs on Tuesday ‚ minutes before Governor Carney put down the first bet. Mr. Geisenberger said that the governor and the casinos had been assembling training materials, updating and testing software, working on logo options and training casino employees and gaming enforcement staff.‚It‚s an exciting day here in Delaware, but days like this don‚t happen by accident,‚ he said.When the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act was enacted in 1992, it included an exemption that allowed Delaware, Montana, Oregon and Nevada to continue at least some sports-betting operations.In Delaware, that was a very niche product of parlay-style wagering on N.F.L. football, Ms. Slane said. That long-existing structure also helped Delaware take the lead.Last week, Governor Carney said in statement that ‚Delaware has all necessary legal and regulatory authority to move forward with a full-scale sports gaming operation.‚On Tuesday, at the news conference, he said, ‚This is really about bringing visitors to our state, giving them things to do when they‚re here.‚In many ways, Delaware‚s geographic position is ideal to draw visitors from major cities; it‚s close to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington. But it may soon face competition from other East Coast states. New Jersey and Pennsylvania are expected to soon follow suit, as are West Virginia and Mississippi.‚You‚ve already seen a handful of states that have passed and enacted laws,‚ Ms. Slane said. ‚It makes it crystal clear that there‚s obviously excitement about the opportunity to launch sports betting.‚","Delaware Kicks Off Full-Scale Sports Betting, a First Outside of Nevada","June 5, 2018 /  5:39 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-gambling-sport-delaware/delaware-sports-betting-first-out-of-gate-but-competitors-close-in-idUSKCN1J12F2,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delaware gained a competitive edge on Tuesday in newly legal sports betting as the first U.S. state in a quarter century to expand its athletics gambling program, but the boost could be short lived as rival states close in, analysts said.  FILE PHOTO: People wait in line to place bets after Super Bowl XLVIII proposition bets were posted at the Las Vegas Hotel & Casino Superbook in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., January 23, 2014. REUTERS/Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus/File PhotoAt 1:30 p.m. EDT, the second smallest state went live, accepting bets on a gamut of professional sports, the first to roll out its betting program since last month’s U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down a 1992 ban. Delaware also became the only East Coast state to offer legal athletics wagering. “Being first out of the gate may offer some first-mover advantages,” said Randy Gerardes, director of municipal securities research for Wells Fargo Securities in New York. “But it’s difficult to ascertain exactly how much activity that will stimulate or how much revenue,” he said. Along with Nevada, Montana and Oregon, which has since suspended its sports betting operations, Delaware was given a partial reprieve from the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992.  Under the exemption, Delaware was allowed only multi-game betting on professional football. As of Tuesday, it was set to also offer single-game and future betting on professional baseball, football, basketball, hockey, golf, soccer and auto racing.  Wagering will at first be confined to the state’s three casinos and then expand online. By already having limited sports betting, Delaware had the rules and infrastructure in place to swiftly expand gambling options when the SCOTUS decision landed, said Marcy Block, senior director at Fitch Ratings in New York. “They were already several steps ahead of a lot of other people,” Block said.

REUTERS/Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus/File PhotoStill, Delaware and other U.S. states with sports gambling operations should not expect a windfall, Block said. “We believe that it’s still going to be a very small part of the overall gaming market,” she said. In a recent analysis, Moody’s Investors Service said that even if every state broadly legalized athletics wagering, it would generate a combined $1.5 billion annually. That is less than 0.2 percent of states’ combined operating funds.  Despite Delaware’s head start, analysts said any competitive edge could quickly soften as more states get betting systems up and running. “Initially they will be able to draw customers from nearby Pennsylvania and Maryland, but that’s going to disappear really fast” as more states enact legal sports betting, said Frank Fantini, who heads Delaware-based gaming industry research firm Fantini Research.  Nearby West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which have already legalized sports betting, are plowing ahead with their programs. New Jersey on Monday advanced its bill to legalize sports betting. Elsewhere, Mississippi, Rhode Island and Connecticut had legalized the practice in anticipation of the SCOTUS decision. More than a dozen other states have introduced legislation to legalize the practice since the ruling.   As those states come on line, players will likely place bets close to home rather than drive across state lines to Delaware.  “Casinos are very much a matter of conveniences, just like banks and 7-Elevens,” Fantini said.

The deals were part of an effort to push more mobile users onto the social network starting in 2007, before stand-alone Facebook apps worked well on phones. The agreements allowed device makers to offer some Facebook features, such as address books, ‚like‚ buttons and status updates.Facebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends ‚ including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.Huawei used its private access to feed a ‚social phone‚ app that let users view messages and social media accounts in one place, according to the officials.Facebook representatives said the data shared with Huawei stayed on its phones, not the company‚s servers.Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who leads the Commerce Committee, has demanded that Facebook provide Congress with details about its data partnerships. ‚Facebook is learning hard lessons that meaningful transparency is a high standard to meet,‚ Mr. Thune said. His committee also oversees the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Facebook to determine whether the company‚s data policies violate a 2011 consent decree with the commission.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia pointed out that concerns about Huawei were not new, citing a 2012 congressional report on the ‚close relationships between the Chinese Communist Party and equipment makers like Huawei.‚‚I look forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that information about their users was not sent to Chinese servers,‚ said Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.‚All Facebook‚s integrations with Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL were controlled from the get-go ‚ and Facebook approved everything that was built,‚ said Francisco Varela, a Facebook vice president. ‚Given the interest from Congress, we wanted to make clear that all the information from these integrations with Huawei was stored on the device, not on Huawei‚s servers.‚Banned in China since 2009, Facebook in recent years has quietly sought to re-establish itself there. The company‚s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has tried to cultivate a relationship with China‚s president, Xi Jinping, and put in an appearance at one of the country‚s top universities.Last year, Facebook released a photo-sharing app in China that was a near replica of its Moments app, but did not put its name on it. And the company has worked on a tool that allowed targeted censorship, prompting some employees to quit over the project.Still, Facebook has struggled to gain momentum, and in January an executive in charge of courting China‚s government left after spending three years on a charm campaign to get the social media service back in the country. None of the Chinese device makers who have partnerships with Facebook responded to requests for comment on Tuesday.Huawei, one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world, is a point of national pride for China and is at the vanguard of the country‚s efforts to expand its influence abroad. The company was the recipient of billions of dollars in lines of credit from China‚s state-owned policy banks, helping to fuel its overseas expansion in Africa, Europe and Latin America. Its founder, Ren Zhengfei, is a former engineer in the People‚s Liberation Army.The United States government has long regarded the company with suspicion, and lawmakers have recommended that American carriers avoid buying the network gear it makes. In January, AT&T walked away from a deal to sell a new Huawei smartphone, the Mate 10.United States officials are investigating whether Huawei broke American trade controls by dealing with Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. The Trump administration has taken aim at Huawei and its rival ZTE in recent weeks, and in April the Federal Communications Commission advanced a plan to bar federally subsidized telecom companies from using suppliers that are considered national security threats.Facebook has not entered into a data-sharing agreement with ZTE, officials at the social network said.TCL, a consumer electronics firm, has accused the Trump administration of bias against Chinese companies and last June dropped a bid to buy a San Diego-based company that makes routers and other hardware.Lenovo, a maker of computers and other devices, recently shelved ambitions to acquire BlackBerry after the Canadian government signaled that such a deal could compromise national security.",Facebook Gave Data Access to Chinese Firm Flagged by U.S. Intelligence,"June 4, 2018 /  12:07 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy/u-s-senate-panel-to-seek-answers-from-facebook-about-data-access-report-idUSKCN1J01HV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee said on Monday he planned to ask Facebook Inc (FB.O) about a New York Times report that the social media company allowed Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and other device makers to have “deep” access to users’ personal data without their consent. “The Commerce Committee will be sending Facebook a letter seeking additional information” about issues including transparency and privacy risks, Republican Senator John Thune said in a statement. Facebook shares fell 0.4 percent to close at $193.28 even as Wall Street’s stock indexes rose for the day. Both Democrats and Republicans raised concerns about the report. The software referred to by the New York Times was launched 10 years ago and used by about 60 companies, including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc, Blackberry Ltd (BB.TO), HTC Corp (2498.TW), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), Facebook’s vice president of product partnerships Ime Archibong wrote in a blog post. The Times said Facebook allowed companies access to the data of users’ friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. The Times report said: “Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users’ friends who believed they had barred any sharing.” Facebook denied that device makers could retrieve personal information from users’ friends if they had barred such sharing. Archibong said the data was only shared with device makers for the purposes of improving Facebook users’ access to the information. “These partners signed agreements that prevented people’s Facebook information from being used for any other purpose than to recreate Facebook-like experiences.”Regulators and authorities in several countries have increased scrutiny of Facebook after it failed to protect the data of some 87 million users that was shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.  Two Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee, Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal, responded to the Times report by writing Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. A woman looks at the Facebook logo on an iPad in this photo illustration taken June 3, 2018. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/Illustration“New revelations that Facebook provided access to users’ personal information, including religion, political preferences, and relationship status, to dozens of mobile device manufacturers without users’ explicit consent are deeply concerning,” they said in a letter.  Facebook said in a statement the company looks “forward to addressing any questions the Commerce Committee may have.”  Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for House Energy and Commerce committee Chairman Greg Walden, a Republican, called the report “a troubling reminder that the expectations tech companies set for consumer protection sometimes differ from what is actually delivered.” Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat, said in a tweet late Sunday it “sure looks like Zuckerberg lied to Congress about whether users have ‘complete control’ over who sees our data on Facebook. This needs to be investigated and the people responsible need to be held accountable.” Facebook told Cicilline in a response to his tweet that the New York Times story was “wrong about user controls.”  U.S. Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said in a statement it was “deeply concerning that Facebook continues to withhold critical details about the information it has and shares with others.” The Federal Trade Commission in March confirmed it was investigating Facebook privacy practices. Archibong also said that these cases were “very different” from the use of data by third party developers in the Cambridge row.

There were balloons and Bible verses, and also misgivings: In a nation that has moved so far in the direction of gay rights in recent years, it wasn‚t clear if Mr. Phillips‚s victory would mean much for long.‚It‚s a win for freedom,‚ said Ray Lapsys, 74, a Catholic. His wife doubted it would last. ‚We‚re praying for that very strongly,‚ said Raminta Lapsys, 66. ‚But I don‚t think so. Satan is strong, and the devil is out there.‚ Six years ago, David Mullins and Charlie Craig went to Mr. Phillips‚s bakery, Masterpiece Cakeshop, hoping to order a cake for their wedding. Mr. Phillips refused to make them a cake, citing his religious objection to same-sex marriage. Soon, Masterpiece Cakeshop, tucked in a quiet strip mall in a Denver suburb, became the center of a bitter culture war and a case that reached the Supreme Court.But that was 2012. In the years since, the State of Colorado and then the Supreme Court have thrown their support behind gay marriage. Civic institutions across the country have come to embrace gay families, often granting them the same treatment as other families.And Colorado ‚ labeled by critics as the ‚hate state‚ in 1992 when voters approved an initiative that barred protected status for sexual orientation ‚ could elect its first openly gay governor this year.Jared Polis, a gay congressman, is among the leading candidates in a governor race that will define the future of this fast-growing state.‚When I first ran for Congress in 2008,‚ Mr. Polis said, ‚we had a whole wall of homophobic hate mail that people had sent.‚ Now, he said, ‚it‚s not really an issue,‚ and people want to vote for the candidate ‚who is going to do something about traffic.‚On Monday, when the Supreme Court justices handed down their decision in the cake case, they kept it narrow, ruling in favor of Mr. Phillips on the grounds that the state‚s Civil Rights Commission, which originally ruled against him, had acted hostile toward religion.The court‚s decision seemed to apply only to the case at hand, and left open the question of whether a business can refuse gay customers by invoking their First Amendment rights.Mr. Phillips, in an email between East Coast news interviews, said that he had lost 40 percent of his business in recent years, because litigation prevented him from making wedding cakes for anyone, gay or straight.This meant he had to fire six of his 10 employees, he said, and the Civil Rights Commission also ordered him to re-educate ‚my 89-year-old mother, my wife and my daughter, by teaching them that I was wrong to run my business consistent with my faith.‚He disagreed with the notion that the ruling would not have larger implications.‚The court recognized,‚ he said, ‚that the government was wrong to punish me for living out my beliefs about marriage. That is significant.‚In many ways, Colorado is a fitting scene for the tug of war between claims of religious freedom and civil rights for gay Americans. It is a purple state that both legalized marijuana and is home to Focus on the Family, an influential conservative organization based in Colorado Springs.The state has moved left in recent years. But its identity still hangs in balance. Jefferson County, which includes Lakewood and the Masterpiece Cakeshop, is among the most politically divided counties in the state. Hillary Clinton won here in 2016 by a slim margin.On Tuesday, white cake boxes lined the walls of the locked shop, visible through a window, along with a handwritten sign propped on a table. ‚When I understand that everything happening to me is to make me more Christ-like,‚ it read, ‚it resolves a great deal of anxiety.‚Ray and Raminta Lapsys, standing on the sidewalk, said they identified strongly with Mr. Phillips. They had come by on Tuesday to celebrate him ‚ and to purchase Ray a cake for his 75th birthday.The Lapsyses are active in their Catholic church.

The joke was shared with the news media, igniting a firestorm in which the president personally promised to pursue leakers.The White House addressed the departure in a brief statement on Tuesday evening, saying that Ms. Sadler was ‚no longer employed within the executive office of the president.‚ The move was first reported by CNN. Still, Ms. Sadler did not leave in light of her comments, according to two people familiar with the situation.Instead, they suggested that Ms. Sadler was pushed out over reports that she had told Mr. Trump that Mercedes Schlapp, the White House strategic communications director, had been the one leaking to the news media. Tensions between the two had reached a point where Ms. Sadler, who worked in the White House communications office focusing on immigration, and Ms. Schlapp were unable to be in the same room together, White House aides said.The White House in recent weeks has reduced the size of the daily communications meeting, and aides have discussed decreasing the size of the communications staff. Such changes have been threatened before, but on Tuesday, one senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that more departures may be coming.In the days after Ms. Sadler‚s comments on Mr. McCain, White House officials dodged questions on whether what Ms. Sadler had said was inappropriate. Instead, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and her deputy Raj Shah have suggested that the leaks were worse than the actual comments. Mr. Shah stressed that the situation was an internal matter, and in an appearance last month on ‚Fox & Friends,‚ the president‚s preferred TV program, Ms. Sanders targeted leakers in particular.‚I think it is disgusting and some of the most shameful behavior that you can ever engage in,‚ Ms. Sanders said. ‚It‚s an honor and a privilege to work for the president and to be part of his administration. Anybody who betrays that, I think, is a total and complete coward. And they should be fired.‚ Members of the Republican leadership did not publicly rally around Mr. McCain after the comments were made. Several Republican senators who met with the president shortly after said they did not have time to bring up the issue.But others lashed out at the White House for its insensitivity.‚People have wondered when decency would hit rock bottom with this administration,‚ former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a statement. ‚Given this White House‚s trail of disrespect toward John and others, this staffer is not the exception to the rule; she is the epitome of it.‚Mr. McCain‚s family expressed astonishment and outrage after the remark became known.‚May I remind you my husband has a family, 7 children and 5 grandchildren,‚ his wife, Cindy McCain, wrote to Ms. Sadler on Twitter.His daughter Meghan McCain asked for a public apology from Ms. Sadler. Ms. Sadler made no public comment but called Ms. McCain to apologize.At ABC News, on an email chain that included the White House statement about Ms. Sadler‚s departure, one network employee ‚ Ms. McCain ‚ replied to everyone: ‚Bye, Felicia.‚","Kelly Sadler, Aide Who Mocked McCain, Leaves White House","June 5, 2018 /  11:00 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-whitehouse-mccain/trump-aide-who-mocked-mccain-has-left-white-house-job-idUSKCN1J132M,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Trump communications aide who joked about U.S. Senator John McCain’s battle with brain cancer has left her White House job, a White House spokesman said on Tuesday.

Sadler’s remarks were widely condemned. The White House refused to confirm or deny whether Sadler had said them. “Kelly Sadler is no longer employed within the Executive Office of the President,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement. McCain, 81, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer last year. He has been receiving treatment in his home state of Arizona and has been absent from the Senate for months.

In Alotenango‚s town square, residents laid out a Mayan altar, placing flowers in a circle around a central flame. People left notes of condolence to the survivors. ‚Our faith has not been buried,‚ read one of them. The village whose residents Mr. Galindo had been trying to save, San Miguel Los Lotes, lay in the path of the flows that tore down the hillside on Sunday, crushing houses and tossing trucks.‚This could have happened to any of us because there were too many people who shouldn‚t have been there and he stayed to the last,‚ said a colleague, Julio Francisco Palma Figueroa, 47, at Mr. Galindo‚s funeral.Firefighters who reached the hardest-hit parts of the village on Tuesday found an eerie, desertlike landscape strewn with boulders. The rescuers walked single file behind a leader testing the unstable ground with a stick, their orange uniforms a jarring contrast with the pallor of the ash.‚Those people didn‚t stand a chance, they were just lying there like statues,‚ said Armando Paredes, a 55, a volunteer firefighter who was among the first to reach the disaster zone on Sunday. ‚Their houses became their tombs.‚ The recovery efforts were interrupted Tuesday as a fiery mix of hot lava blocks, ash and volcanic gas coursed down the south side of the volcano. The government issued warnings that rainfall could create dangerous new flows of ash and debris down the mountainsides. Rescue workers, police officers and journalists hurried to leave the area, The Associated Press reported.Above it all, the volcano was shrouded in smoke and clouds.The death toll stood at 70 on Tuesday, but officials feared that it could grow much higher. Many of the recovered bodies were too badly burned to be identified.The nation‚s disaster response agency said it knew of 192 people who were missing, and it created a website for people to report missing friends and relatives.Some asked whether the authorities had moved quickly enough to order evacuations, and whether volcano victims in villages around the mountain had been neglected. La Reuni√≥n Golf Course and Residences, a luxury resort on the volcano‚s slopes, was destroyed. But unlike the villages, the resort was evacuated in time.Karin Slowing, a former planning and budget secretary for the Guatemalan government, said an independent study would be needed to determine why the evacuation did not occur earlier. One problem is that government corruption over the past decade has led to a deterioration of institutions.‚There is not even a census,‚ Ms. Slowing said. ‚What evacuation plans can you have when you don‚t know how many communities there are, how many people there are, how many children, how many elderly people?‚Without protocols and regular drills, it is impossible to organize a swift evacuation when an eruption hits. ‚These aren‚t things you can improvise,‚ she said.Fuego is one of three active volcanoes that present a risk to the communities living nearby, Ms. Slowing said, but Guatemala faces the risk of natural disaster across its territory ‚ from earthquakes to floods ‚ and its poorer citizens often settle in risk-prone areas.In 2015, about 270 people were buried when the wall of a ravine collapsed onto a community on the outskirts of the capital, Guatemala City. The risks to the settlement, El Cambray II, had long been known to the authorities.","Guatemala Volcano Stirs Anew, and Survivors Wait for News","June 7, 2018 /  6:35 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-guatemala-volcano-response/guatemala-volcano-alert-too-late-to-save-lives-officials-admit-idUSKCN1J32K5,"EL RODEO, Guatemala (Reuters) - A communication breakdown between a disaster agency and volcanologists in Guatemala delayed evacuations as gas and ash clouds cascaded down the Fuego volcano last Sunday in its most violent eruption in four decades, authorities have admitted.  Firefighters carry a stretcher at an area affected by an eruption of the Fuego volcano in San Miguel Los Lotes, Escuintla, Guatemala June 7, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos JassoCompounding the situation, rain and clouds hid signs of the toxic shower of debris, known as a pyroclastic flow, hurtling down the mountainside, hindering visual observation.  The scalding material that poured out of Fuego, which means “Fire” in Spanish, has killed 100 people, with more than 190 missing, authorities say, as rescue work on Thursday was suspended as it was too dangerous for the workers. Almost all the victims are from poor, coffee-growing hamlets on the mountain’s lower slopes that are now partially buried.  By the time Pedro Morales, a field technician at Guatemala’s disaster agency, caught sight of the debris flows, which can move at speeds of up to 190 miles per hour (300 kph), they were already drawing close to houses. “When you could finally see it, it was underneath the rain cloud, on the low part very close to homes,” he said.  “It was already too close to the town.” While the poor visibility delayed villagers’ own reactions to the impending danger, 27 miles (43 km) away in Guatemala City, disaster authorities failed to understand the magnitude of the eruption, meaning the alert level leading to mandatory evacuations was not raised quickly enough, the heads of the responsible government agencies admitted on Wednesday. That meant people were left in their homes for hours after the dangerous flows began and has led to opposition calls for criminal charges and resignations.   Guatemala’s public prosecutor said on Thursday that it would open an investigation into whether protocols were followed to inform proper decision-making in the handling of the disaster.

REUTERS/Carlos JassoIn a tense meeting at Guatemala’s Congress on Wednesday, the head of the country’s volcanology institute accused his counterpart at disaster agency CONRED of failing to heed bulletins warning that Fuego was dangerously erupting.  CONRED chief Sergio Cabanas accepted the evacuation order was late, but blamed the volcanologists for not being explicit enough that the situation was dangerous. The reports did not include enough details of the volcanic activity, and which communities it would affect, he said.  When asked if he had received a bulletin, he responded, “Sure, but it doesn’t say anything.”  The first bulletin from the volcanologists warned of pyroclastic flows descending from Fuego at 6 a.m. (1200 GMT) on Sunday, some eight hours before the disaster agency seriously stepped up evacuation efforts.  Brandishing the morning bulletin, senior opposition lawmaker Mario Taracena accused Cabanas of incompetence, saying he bore criminal responsibility for the deaths.   “Anybody in this room with a bit of common sense would have done something,” he said. “You are the head of the disaster agency and you didn’t care.”  Such institutional disorganization can be fatal, said Jeff Schlegelmilch, deputy director of Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness. Slideshow (6 Images)Disaster agencies need to focus on early-warning systems to avoid the scramble of split-second decisions once emergencies hit, he said. “At the time that the volcano erupts, you only have what you have at that moment,” he said. “Your plans are either there or they’re not.”  CHAOTIC EVACUATION    Families grappling to come to terms with the loss of life and homes in the hardest hit village, El Rodeo, on the south side of Fuego, also pointed fingers at the government for not doing more to warn them.  Construction worker Victor Martinez, 42, mourned the death of his friend, a pastor who was killed inside a village church buried under the ash. The pastor’s five grandchildren also lost their lives.  “It’s because of CONRED that so many families have died. They carry the responsibility for everything because they didn’t get people out,” he said, after digging for hours through the brown ash to retrieve audio equipment inside the church. By the time evacuation orders reached the villages, the response was chaotic, and the flows were already bursting through the cloud shrouding the mountain. “We saw people from CONRED passing by in their cars, but my wife only realized what was happening when people came fleeing,” said electrician Jose Amilcar Acajabon Fuentes, 45.  He and his wife joined the sprinting crowd and managed to get away. Morales, the volcano expert, watched the disaster unfold after he was sent to monitor following the 6 a.m. bulletin. He said that in another village, an official hollered for residents to evacuate while weaving through the streets in a three-wheel taxi known as a “tuk-tuk.”  Many locals eating lunch inside their homes either did not hear or ignored the warnings, while torrents of scorching rocks and fatal gases quietly raced closer.  “Pyroclastic flows don’t make big sounds like an explosion,” Morales said. “Pyroclastic flows are silent, but deadly.”           Reporting by Sofia Menchu; Additional reporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Writing by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Rosalba O'BrienOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Guatemala volcano alert too late to save lives, officials admit",Y

In a statement issued along with its verdict, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg said they remained free not to do so. But, the court added, ‚They may not obstruct the freedom of residence of an E.U. citizen by refusing to grant his same-sex spouse, a national of a country that is not an E.U. member state, a derived right of residence in their territory.‚The decision came a day after the United States Supreme Court ruled, in another closely watched case, that a baker could refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.As different as the two cases ‚ and their results ‚ were, the decisions had something important in common: The judges did not treat them as being about gay rights. The American case was decided on fairly narrow, procedural grounds and the baker‚s religious beliefs, while the European court based its ruling on the free movement of people.The case before the court involved a Romanian activist, Adrian Coman, and his American husband, Claibourn Robert Hamilton, who were married in Belgium in 2010.When they tried to move to Romania a few years later, the country denied Mr. Hamilton spousal residency rights, as it does not recognize same-sex marriage. The couple, who now live in the United States, filed suit in Romania in 2013.The Court of Justice took up the case in November 2016, after Romania‚s Constitutional Court requested an interpretation of European Union law.For L.G.B.T. rights groups, the verdict has been a long time coming.‚In 2004, when the freedom of movement directive was adopted, the term spouse was deliberately left vague. Since then same-sex couples have been left in a legal limbo, in uncertainty,‚ said Katrin Hugendubel, the advocacy director at ILGA-Europe, a Brussels-based group that promotes gay and transgender rights.With this case, she added, the court has clarified that all European Union member states need to recognize marriages carried out in other member states, and that all European citizens and their spouses have ‚full freedom of movement, which is one of the four fundamentals of the European Union.‚ Romania decriminalized homosexuality only in 2001, and it joined the European Union in 2007.The court‚s verdict came at an important moment, with a referendum expected in the coming months on whether to change the constitutional definition of marriage to specify that it must be a union between a man and a woman.The referendum, which came about after a 2016 petition gathered three million signatures, would make it harder for the country to legalize same-sex marriages in the future.‚This is a worrying time for all of us who want to live in a more inclusive society,‚ said Florin Buhuceanu, president of the Romanian advocacy group Accept. ‚We are living in the 21st century, in the E.U.,‚ he added. ‚It is the right time to start recognizing these families as families.‚Thirteen of the European Union‚s 28 member states currently allow same-sex marriage, while a further nine allow civil unions or something similar. Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia have neither.Robert Wintemute, a professor of human rights law at King‚s College London, said that the principle that spouses include same-sex partners will be immediately binding for all courts in the bloc‚s current members, and for those in any countries that join later.It could also put pressure on the six member states without legal recognition of same-sex unions to introduce some form of legislation, he added.The verdict was widely expected. In January, a senior legal adviser to the court, Advocate General Melchior Wathelet, issued an opinion that highlighted the evolution of member states‚ views on same-sex marriage over the previous decade.Definitions of marriage as a union only between two people of the opposite sex were no longer generally accepted by European Union countries, he said.The couple‚s lawyer, Iustina Ionescu, described the case as ‚not just about same-sex marriage but about what the E.U. stands for ‚ dignity, equality, respect for basic freedoms for all of us.‚ And while the ruling is limited to same-sex couples married in a European member state, Ms. Ionescu believes the verdict suggests that any future case brought by a couple married outside the bloc would be successful.Mr. Coman said in an interview that he had dreamed about this moment for a long time, adding, ‚I can barely believe it.‚Still, he said, he had been optimistic about the eventual verdict. ‚Come on, it‚s 2018, it‚s one of the core freedoms of the E.U.,‚ he said. ‚But we didn‚t expect it to take this long.‚",Same-Sex Marriages Are Backed in E.U. Immigration Ruling,"June 6, 2018 /  5:05 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-court-lgbt/eu-same-sex-marriage-challenger-says-battle-not-over-idUSKCN1J22B0,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Romanian man who mounted a legal challenge over his country’s refusal to give his American husband residency said on Wednesday the battle was not over despite a landmark ruling in his favor from the European Union’s top court. Adrian Coman said he was relieved by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling on Tuesday that Romania must grant his husband residency rights even though it does not recognize same-sex marriage. But he said the case would now go back to Romania’s top court and the couple, who live in New York, would not be packing their bags just yet. “We are not with the bags packed in sum because this can take very long,” Coman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Bucharest in a phone interview. “We will plan our lives only when there is a final decision.”  “We are relieved at the same time because we were aware of the impact of the decision,” he said, adding an unfavorable ruling would have set a legal precedent for other couples.    The case, which highlighted social differences between western Europe and a more conservative east, arose because Hamilton’s right as a non-EU citizen to live in Romania permanently was dependent on his status as Coman’s spouse. Coman challenged a Romanian decision to limit Hamilton’s residence to a three-month visa, and a Romanian court referred the matter to the ECJ in Luxembourg.  The ECJ ruled that Romania must treat Hamilton as Coman’s spouse under EU law and accept the validity of their 2010 Belgian marriage. “We are two ordinary people who did not accept injustice and our message is that (others) should do the same if they can, because life could be different,” said Coman. The case did not touch on the freedom of member states to set their own matrimony laws, although campaigners have called on Brussels to push states to legalize same-sex marriage as a fundamental human right. Rather, it upheld rights of EU citizens to move freely across the bloc along with their families. Coman said Hamilton would fly to Bucharest from New York on Friday to celebrate their 16th anniversary together. The couple settled in New York after their plan to live in Romania hit the rocks in 2012, but hope to resettle to Bucharest at some point in the future, Coman said. “Our lives are not the same, but what we have learned that life can change quickly,” he said.  “We should be able to move to Romania when we want not when the Romanian government wants.” Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Claire Cozens.

He also told the semiofficial Iranian Students‚ News Agency that Tehran would increase its capacity to produce uranium hexafluoride, a feedstock for centrifuges. It was unclear whether the assembly center would actually begin to produce new centrifuges.Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran stopped enriching uranium to the 20 percent level that would allow for rapid development of a nuclear weapon and agreed to a limit of under 5 percent. It will adhere to that limit, Iran‚s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech on Monday.It was also uncertain whether the opening of the centrifuge plant would have any significant impact on Iran‚s nuclear program, which continues to be closely monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. When Tehran agreed in 2015 to roll back its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international and United States sanctions, European companies rushed to enter the Iranian market. European governments have been working to keep the deal alive and protect those investments after President Trump dismayed many on the Continent by withdrawing and reimposing banking sanctions.However, the American sanctions would still be a major problem, particularly for multinational companies, and several European firms have already announced plans to pull out of Iran. On Monday, the French group PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citro√´n cars, which produces 440,000 vehicles a year in Iran, started closing its joint ventures with local auto manufacturers, though PSA said it would seek a waiver from the United States to maintain that production level. In his speech on Monday, Ayatollah Khamenei warned the Europeans that Iran‚s patience was limited, but analysts said that Tehran‚s demands of guaranteed purchases of Iranian oil and free bank transfers with the European Union might exceed what the bloc could deliver.‚The Europeans expect the Iranian nation to tolerate and grapple with the sanctions, to give up their nuclear activities, which is an absolute requirement for the future of the country, and also to continue with the restrictions that have been imposed on them,‚ Ayatollah Khamenei said. ‚I would tell these governments that this bad dream will not come true.‚The Trump administration has shown no outward willingness to compromise on Iran. If anything, it has hardened its position that any companies that engage with Iran do so at their own peril.In a speech on Tuesday in Washington, the Treasury under secretary in charge of sanctions enforcement, Sigal Mandelker, said that the administration views Iran as a haven for terrorism financing, duplicity and human rights abuses.‚The Iranian regime will deceive your companies, undermine the integrity of your financial systems, and put your institutions at risk of our powerful sanctions,‚ Ms. Mandelker said. ‚You must harden your financial networks, require your companies to do extra due diligence to keep them from being caught in Iran‚s deceptive web, and make clear the very significant risks of doing business with companies and persons in Iran.‚",Iran Moves to Lift Its Nuclear Enrichment Capacity,"June 5, 2018 /  9:59 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear/iran-is-preparing-for-possible-increase-of-enrichment-capacity-if-deal-fails-nuclear-chief-idUSKCN1J113Q,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran has begun preparations to boost its uranium enrichment capacity, its nuclear chief said on Tuesday, adding to pressure on European powers trying to save a nuclear accord with Tehran in peril after a U.S. withdrawal. France, Britain and Germany want to salvage the 2015 deal’s core bargain of sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on Tehran’s atomic activities. Washington has reimposed sanctions against Tehran since quitting the deal last month, arguing Iran posed a security threat. Iran has set out conditions to stay in the nuclear deal, including steps to safeguard trade with Tehran and guarantee Iranian oil sales. But it has also said it could resume its 20 percent uranium enrichment, which is banned under the deal. Iran was developing infrastructure for building advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility, Ali Akbar Salehi, director of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation said in a news conference broadcast on state television. Related CoverageEconomic pressure will kill off Iran nuclear deal: NetanyahuIran tells IAEA it plans to produce feedstock for centrifugesSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday he had ordered preparations for Iran to have greater enrichment capacity if the deal falls apart. Iran’s nuclear agency said it would inform the U.N. nuclear watchdog on Tuesday the process to increase capacity had begun.   Salehi said this did not violate the nuclear deal but that it marked an increase in the pace of the nuclear programme.

The 2015 agreement allows Iran to continue 3.67 percent uranium enrichment, far below the roughly 90 percent threshold of weapons-grade. Before the deal was reached, Tehran enriched uranium to up to 20 percent purity. Salehi’s comments Tuesday appeared to be a warning to the remaining signatories of possible consequences if the deal were to collapse. European powers still back the deal but have concerns over Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its influence in the Middle East. Iran says the two issues are non-negotiable.

When Tehran agreed in 2015 to roll back its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international and United States sanctions, European companies rushed to enter the Iranian market. European governments have been working to keep the deal alive and protect those investments after President Trump dismayed many on the Continent by withdrawing and reimposing banking sanctions.However, the American sanctions would still be a major problem, particularly for multinational companies, and several European firms have already announced plans to pull out of Iran. On Monday, the French group PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citro√´n cars, which produces 440,000 vehicles a year in Iran, started closing its joint ventures with local auto manufacturers, though PSA said it would seek a waiver from the United States to maintain that production level. In his speech on Monday, Ayatollah Khamenei warned the Europeans that Iran‚s patience was limited, but analysts said that Tehran‚s demands of guaranteed purchases of Iranian oil and free bank transfers with the European Union might exceed what the bloc could deliver.‚The Europeans expect the Iranian nation to tolerate and grapple with the sanctions, to give up their nuclear activities, which is an absolute requirement for the future of the country, and also to continue with the restrictions that have been imposed on them,‚ Ayatollah Khamenei said. ‚I would tell these governments that this bad dream will not come true.‚The Trump administration has shown no outward willingness to compromise on Iran. If anything, it has hardened its position that any companies that engage with Iran do so at their own peril.In a speech on Tuesday in Washington, the Treasury under secretary in charge of sanctions enforcement, Sigal Mandelker, said that the administration views Iran as a haven for terrorism financing, duplicity and human rights abuses.‚The Iranian regime will deceive your companies, undermine the integrity of your financial systems, and put your institutions at risk of our powerful sanctions,‚ Ms. Mandelker said. ‚You must harden your financial networks, require your companies to do extra due diligence to keep them from being caught in Iran‚s deceptive web, and make clear the very significant risks of doing business with companies and persons in Iran.‚",Iran Moves to Lift Its Nuclear Enrichment Capacity,"June 4, 2018 /  10:35 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-iaea/iran-to-inform-iaea-of-start-of-process-to-boost-uranium-enrichment-capacity-isna-idUSKCN1J02ZU,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran will inform the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Vienna on Tuesday over its start of a process to increase the country’s uranium enrichment capacity, Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi told ISNA news agency. The flag of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) flutters in front of their headquarters in Vienna, Austria June 4, 2018.   REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger“In a letter that will be handed over to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ... Iran will announce that the process of increasing the capacity to produce ... UF6 (uranium hexafluoride) ... will start on Tuesday,” Kamalvandi said. He said Iran had the capacity to accelerate production of centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium. The UF6 is a feedstock for centrifuges.  Iran’s ultimate authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday he had ordered preparations to increase uranium enrichment capacity if a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers falls apart after the U.S. withdrawal from it last month. “The leader (Khamenei) meant that we should accelerate some process ... linked to our nuclear work capacity to move forward faster in case needed,” Kamalvandi said. European signatories of the accord back the deal but have concerns over Iran’s ballistic missile program and its influence in the Middle East. Iran says the two issues are non-negotiable.  Under the agreement with the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, Iran strictly limited uranium enrichment capacity to satisfy the powers that it could not be used to develop atomic bombs.  In exchange, Iran received relief from sanctions, most of which were rescinded in January 2016.  The deal allows Iran to continue 3.67 percent uranium enrichment, far below the roughly 90 percent threshold of weapons-grade. Before the deal was reached, Tehran enriched uranium to up to 20 percent purity.  Since President Donald Trump’s announcement of the U.S. exit on May 8, EU leaders have pledged to try to keep Iran’s oil trade and investment flowing but admitted that will not be easy to do. Iranian authorities have said that if the European countries failed to keep the pact alive, Tehran had several options, including resuming its 20 percent uranium enrichment.

Bags that had sold for $50 the previous week fetched $300 on June 5, in line with new bags. “Whenever an artist of any kind passes, it’s a common thing that you see both demand for their products increase and average price also increase,” said Kamini Lane, chief marketing officer of the Santa Monica-based company. “But I’ve never seen a jump this significant before.” FILE PHOTO: The outside of a Kate Spade store is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., June 5, 2018.  REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo    The 55-year-old designer, who with her husband built a fashion empire on the popularity of affordable luxury, was found dead in her New York City apartment on Tuesday in an apparent suicide.     Lane recalled that when the high-end couture designer Azzedine Alaia, who dressed stars from Greta Garbo to Grace Jones and Lady Gaga, died last November, the platform saw a spike in the sale of Alaia items, but it was nowhere close to the story of Spade.     “Kate Spade was so accessible to so many people and therefore desired by a broader base,” she said, adding that  after Spade’s death the platform was selling “hundreds of items a day.”     Kate Spade’s brightly colored, clean-lined accessories and bags offered a spunky style to younger working women at a time when luxury handbags were out of reach of most consumers and the industry was dominated by venerable European brands.     Kate and her husband Andy Spade sold their last stake in the Kate Spade accessories brand in 2006 and in 2016 launched a new footwear and accessories brand called Frances Valentine, named after their daughter. Last month high-end handbag maker Tapestry Inc (TPR.N), which bought the Kate Spade brand a year ago, said that sales at established stores were disappointing because of a reduction in discounting of new bags, which cost around $200 to $300. Tapestry was not immediately available for comment.     Online thrift store thredUP said it had sold three times as many Kate Spade items on Tuesday, the day she died, than on Monday. Items with the Kate Spade logo, primarily bags, were most in demand, with users buying more than 3 times as many Kate Spade handbags the day of and day after Spade’s death, when compared against the three month trailing average for Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the company said.

The change in location of the game ignited protests from Palestinian activists, who displayed bloodstained shirts at a demonstration in Barcelona, where Argentina is practicing for the World Cup beginning June 14.Both Israeli officials and officials with the Argentine Football Association said threats had been made against Lionel Messi, the star of Argentina‚s national team, and other members of the team.‚My responsibility as the president of the A.F.A. is to work for the safety of my people, which is why I made this decision,‚ the associations‚s president, Claudio Tapia, said in a short statement to the news media in Barcelona. Changing the location of the game, a move pushed by Israel‚s sports minister, Miri Regev, ‚turned a sporting event that had economic ends into a political issue and it became about supporting the state of Israel,‚ said Angela Lerena, an Argentine sports journalist. ‚Somebody at some point decided it could be a good propaganda opportunity.‚Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had called Argentine President Mauricio Macri of Argentina on Tuesday in an attempt to get the game back on.Mr. Macri, who was once president of Boca Juniors, one of the most popular soccer clubs in Argentina, then spoke with officials at the Argentine soccer association. But Mr. Macri was told the players had decided against traveling, said a government official who works with the president but spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.‚Macri apologized to Netanyahu but said that if the players don‚t want to go there was nothing he could do,‚ the official said.Argentine government officials said they had warned the association that playing the match in Jerusalem could cause trouble. President Trump this spring moved the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv and recognized Jerusalem as Israel‚s capital, angering Palestinians who hope to see the eastern part of the city become the capital of a future Palestinian state. ‚When it became known that it would be in Jerusalem, the first thing we did was get in touch with A.F.A. to alert them about the sensitivity and delicate situation that this implied, including because it could involve security issues,‚ the Argentine foreign minister, Jorge Faurie, said in an interview with local radio station Mitre.Israeli officials reacted bitterly to the cancellation of the game.‚It‚s unfortunate the soccer knights of Argentina did not withstand the pressure of the Israeli-hating inciters, whose only goal is to harm our basic right to self-defense and bring about the destruction of Israel,‚ the Defense Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, wrote on Twitter.Israel‚s ambassador to Argentina, Ilan Sztulman, retweeted a message from Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, thanking Argentina for the cancellation. ‚If a terrorist group congratulates you ‚¶‚ he wrote.‚I understand the fear that players have but I can assure you Israel is a very safe place,‚ Mr. Sztulman said in an interview with the cable news channel Todo Noticias.Palestinian soccer officials, however, praised the cancellation.‚The Israelis tried to use Messi and those stars from Argentina, and I would like to thank them and appreciate their decision, which I think was on the right track,‚  Jibril Rajoub, the president of the Palestinian Football Association, said at a news conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah.In the streets of Argentina‚s capital some people sought to look past the Mideast geopolitics that are widely debated here and focused their ire on the management of the national soccer team.‚Not that we needed it but it again showed how the management of Argentine football is a huge mafia,‚ said Lorena Quiroga, a 40-year-old small business owner. ‚All they care about is money, not the players.‚ There was also concern the matter would upset the psyche of players ahead of the World Cup. Argentina is expected to contend for the title; it lost to Germany, 1-0, in the 2014 final.‚This will really bring down the team‚s enthusiasm at a time when they should be focused on the game,‚ said Gustavo Taboada, a 25-year-old electrician.Emanuel Estevez, 32, a driver, was optimistic the cancellation would prove to be good news for the squad.‚Imagine how many days of stress it would have meant for them to go somewhere they felt their lives were at risk,‚ he said. ‚Now it‚s done, they can relax, just stay in Barcelona and focus on bringing home the cup.‚",Argentina-Israel Soccer Game Canceled Over Playing in Jerusalem,"June 3, 2018 /  8:06 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-messi/soccer-fans-should-burn-messi-shirts-if-he-plays-in-jerusalem-palestinian-idUSKCN1IZ0VM,"RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - The Palestine Football Association chief urged fans on Sunday  to burn pictures of Argentina striker Lionel Messi and replicas of his shirt if he plays against Israel in Jerusalem next weekend. Soccer Football - FIFA World Cup - Argentina Training - Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper, Barcelona, Spain - June 1, 2018   Argentina's Lionel Messi during training   REUTERS/Albert GeaTwice world champions Argentina will play at Jerusalem’s  Teddy Kollek Stadium on Saturday night in a World Cup warm-up match that has attracted huge interest among the Israeli fans, mainly because of Messi’s planned participation. But the Palestinians are not happy that the match will be held in Jerusalem and Palestinian FA chief Jibril Rajoub wrote to Claudio Tapia, the head of the Argentinian FA, last week  accusing Israel of using the match as a “political tool”. The stadium that will host the match is in west Jerusalem. The Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital of a future state that will include the Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. However, the status of the city generally is highly sensitive. The match was originally slated to be played in Haifa but Israeli authorities contributed funding for it to be moved to Jerusalem, irking Palestinians further following U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of the city as Israel’s capital. The U.S. embassy was moved there last month. “The Israeli government has turned a regular sports match into a political tool. As was widely covered in Argentinian media, the match now is being played in order to celebrate the ‘70th anniversary of the State of Israel’,” part of Rajoub’s letter said. On Sunday, Rajoub declared a campaign against Argentina and particularly Messi, noting he has millions of fans across the Arab and Islamic world, Asia and Africa. “He’s a big symbol so we are going to target him personally and we call on all to burn his picture and his shirt and to abandon him. We still hope that Messi will not come,” he told reporters after leaving the Argentinian representative office in the West Bank town of Ramallah. A small group of youths wearing Palestine soccer scarves demonstrated outside the representation office and attempted to set fire to an Argentinian flag. Rajoub has long tried to get soccer’s world governing body, FIFA, and the International Olympic Committee to impose sanctions against Israel. This is mainly because of the Israeli government’s settlements policy in the West Bank and because it has imposed travel restrictions on Palestinian athletes citing security concerns. Those bodies have not heeded his calls.      Argentina have made four previous pre-World Cup stopovers in Israel since 1986. The team has been drawn in World Cup Group D and will open its campaign against Iceland in Moscow on June 16.   Most countries do not recognize either Israel’s or the Palestinians’ sovereignty in Jerusalem and have embassies to Israel in the Tel Aviv area. However, Guatemala and Honduras followed the U.S. lead in moving their embassies last month.

Bags that had sold for $50 the previous week fetched $300 on June 5, in line with new bags. “Whenever an artist of any kind passes, it’s a common thing that you see both demand for their products increase and average price also increase,” said Kamini Lane, chief marketing officer of the Santa Monica-based company. “But I’ve never seen a jump this significant before.” FILE PHOTO: The outside of a Kate Spade store is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., June 5, 2018.

Last month high-end handbag maker Tapestry Inc (TPR.N), which bought the Kate Spade brand a year ago, said that sales at established stores were disappointing because of a reduction in discounting of new bags, which cost around $200 to $300. Tapestry was not immediately available for comment.     Online thrift store thredUP said it had sold three times as many Kate Spade items on Tuesday, the day she died, than on Monday. Items with the Kate Spade logo, primarily bags, were most in demand, with users buying more than 3 times as many Kate Spade handbags the day of and day after Spade’s death, when compared against the three month trailing average for Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the company said.

They loved each other very much.‚‚Katy was very happy most of the time, the funniest person in the world, and sometimes she would get really sad,‚ Ms. Arons continued. She said she watched her friend‚s condition develop ‚slowly, over time. We would talk a lot about it, and end up laughing,‚ she said.‚She really felt she could power through it on her own,‚ she said. Sometimes the subject came up in the context of news of a celebrity suicide and, Ms. Arons said, ‚she‚d say to me, ‚I would never do that. I would never do that. I would never do that,‚ and I believed her.‚",Andy Spade on Kate Spade‚Äôs Death: ‚ÄòThere Was No Indication and No Warning‚Äô,"June 5, 2018 /  4:24 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/people-kate-spade/update-5-kate-spade-designer-who-built-handbag-empire-found-dead-idUSL2N1T713D,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kate Spade, the designer who built a fashion empire on the popularity of her signature handbags before selling the brand, was found dead in her New York City apartment on Tuesday morning in an apparent suicide, police said. Spade, 55, hanged herself and was found by her housekeeper at her home on Park Avenue on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, the New York Daily News reported, citing unnamed police officials. Born Katherine Noel Brosnahan in Kansas City, Missouri, Spade was a former accessories editor at the now-closed Mademoiselle magazine before she and Andy Spade launched their namesake design company, Kate Spade New York, in 1993. The couple married the following year. They began by selling handbags before expanding to include clothing, jewelry, bedding, legwear and fragrances.  The brand grew into a fashion empire, known for accessories that offered affordable luxury to younger working women. Her brightly colored, clean-lined style offered a spunky take on fashion at time when luxury handbags were out of reach to most consumers and the industry was dominated by venerable European brands.  The couple sold their last stake in the brand in 2006 to focus on raising their daughter, Frances Beatrix Spade. In 2016, they launched a new footwear and accessories brand called Frances Valentine, naming it after their daughter, who is now 13. Tapestry Inc, the handbag company formerly known as Coach, eventually bought the Kate Spade brand in May 2017 to tap millennials, who are drawn to the company’s quirky satchels and colorful tote bags. The company’s share price dipped by 1 percent to $44.68 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Kate Spade New York released a statement calling the news “incredibly sad.”  FILE PHOTO:    Kate Spade arrives at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards in New York on June 2, 2003, at the New York Public Library. REUTERS/Chip East/File Photo“Although Kate has not been affiliated with the brand for more than a decade, she and her husband and creative partner, Andy, were the founders of our beloved brand,” the statement said. “Kate will be dearly missed.” The Council of Fashion Designers of America in a statement called Spade “a great talent who had an immeasurable impact on American fashion and the way the world viewed American accessories.” The New York City chief medical examiner’s office said the cause of Spade’s death was under investigation.  In response to the death, fans of the brand began posting pictures of their favorite handbags on social media. Chelsea Clinton, former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s daughter, was among celebrities mourning Spade. “My grandmother gave me my first Kate Spade bag when I was in college,” she wrote on Twitter. “I still have it.”  Ivanka Trump, a daughter of and adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, described Spade’s death on Twitter as “a painful reminder that we never truly know another’s pain or the burden they carry.” Slideshow (8 Images)Spade told National Public Radio (NPR) last year that she first discussed starting a handbag company with Andy Spade while they ate at a Mexican restaurant in 1991. “I said, ‘Honey, you don’t just start a handbag company,’” she told NPR, “and he said, ‘Why not, how hard can it be?’” Reporting by Jonathan Allen, Peter Szekely, Barbara Goldberg and Gina Cherelus; additional reporting by Alexandria Sage, Melissa Fares, Richa Naidu and Jill Serjeant; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Marguerita ChoyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Kate Spade, designer who built handbag empire, found dead",R

Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass and John F. Kennedy have all spoken from its stage, and political rallies, debates and civic events still take place within its walls, making Faneuil Hall ‚ pronounced ‚FAN-yul‚ ‚ a living monument.But its namesake, Peter Faneuil, one of the richest merchants in 18th century New England, was a slave owner. And he traded not only in sugar, molasses and timber, but in humans. That has drawn the attention of some faith leaders and others who want to remove Faneuil‚s name from the iconic landmark.‚Faneuil Hall insults the dignity of blacks and all Americans who believe in the civic dignity of all,‚ Kevin C. Peterson, founder of a group called the New Democracy Coalition, said in a statement.Boston proudly reveres its history, but the city also wrestles with long-held perceptions that it is inhospitable to people who aren‚t white, a sense reinforced last year when the comedian Michael Che called Boston ‚the most racist city I‚ve ever been to.‚Much of that reputation stems from violence that erupted against court-ordered school busing in the 1970s. But it started before then and still persists, in everything from virulent bigotry at its sports stadiums to the city‚s gaping income inequality, leaving Boston perpetually asking whether it can ever get past the stain of racism. For a city perceived as one of the nation‚s bastions of liberalism, its relationship with issues of race is complex.Against this backdrop, the New Democracy Coalition submitted a petition this week to the Boston City Council to start the process of renaming Faneuil Hall, which is owned by the city but operated as a visitor center and historic site by the National Park Service. Mr. Peterson has suggested that Faneuil Hall be renamed for Crispus Attucks, an African-American man who was the first person killed during the Boston Massacre in 1770; he is considered the first casualty of the American Revolution.ImagePeter Faneuil, one of the wealthiest merchants in 18th-century New England, was a slave owner and trader.City officials have not said what they intend to do, though Mayor Martin J. Walsh says he does not support changing the name.‚If we were to change the name of Faneuil Hall today, 30 years from now, no one would know why we did it,‚ the mayor said in a statement to The New York Times.‚Not many people know about the history of that man,‚ he added. ‚And over the years, Faneuil Hall has become a place where good things have happened,‚ he said. He noted that Douglass called for an end to slavery from the hall and that every year, hundreds of people gather in the hall to take their oath of citizenship.‚What we should do instead is figure out a way to acknowledge the history so people understand it,‚ the mayor concluded. ‚We can‚t erase history, but we can learn from it.‚Tourists visiting Faneuil Hall this week, many of whom were white, were overwhelmingly against changing the name. ‚I don‚t like to tinker with history,‚ said Matt Birch, 32, an online editor who is white and lives in Washington, D.C., and was browsing in a bookshop in the building. ‚This is our country‚s roots and it helped form our national identity.‚His mother, Nina, 64, a retired accountant, felt the same. ‚It is what it is because of what it was,‚ she said. ‚That‚s why we‚re here.‚Boston has been receptive to other name changes. In April, officials voted to rename Yawkey Way, a street outside Fenway Park; Tom Yawkey was a former Red Sox owner who did not add a black player to his roster until 12 years after Jackie Robinson signed with the Dodgers.Historically, Boston is often remembered for its role in seeking to abolish slavery. But the trans-Atlantic slave trade played an integral role in the economy of colonial New England. The first slave ship to reach Boston arrived in 1638, when colonists traded Native Americans who had been captured in battle for enslaved Africans.Merchants who grew wealthy from the slave trade founded and endowed several Ivy League colleges, some of which have distanced themselves from these legacies in the last 15 years or so. In 2016, Harvard Law School dropped its official seal because it featured the family crest of prominent slaveholders.In 2015 a ceremony was held in Boston to acknowledge the city‚s role in both the harrowing ‚Middle Passage‚ of the slave trade and in the abolition of slavery. That ceremony was held at Faneuil Hall, where Mr. Faneuil‚s own involvement in slavery was just starting to reach the public consciousness. About 20 million people visit Faneuil Hall every year, many of them seeking a touchstone of the American Revolution. Many know that patriots met at the hall to organize against British oppression, earning Faneuil Hall the moniker ‚the cradle of liberty.‚But in a random sample of a dozen visitors this week, no one knew who Mr. Faneuil was ‚ or that some of the treasure he spent to build the hall in the 1740s derived from the slave trade.When told about his past, most said they did not see a reason to remove Mr. Faneuil‚s name. Erasing it, they said, would be tantamount to wiping away part of history, which, they said, should be remembered, despicable as it was.‚I don‚t condone slavery, but this is a historical landmark,‚ said Angie Musil, 41, who is white and works as an office assistant at an elementary school in Minnesota. She said her family had recently visited Monticello, the Virginia home of Thomas Jefferson. Although Jefferson owned slaves, she said, ‚they haven‚t shut down Monticello.‚But Alex King, 20, a black student visiting with his class from a school outside of Boston, said he thought changing the name seemed like a good idea.‚You can create better harmony in your community, so people aren‚t offended or triggered in a certain way,‚ he said. Last year, the nation plunged into a debate after a deadly riot in Charlottesville, Va., over plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee.Several cities and towns took down or renamed historic symbols honoring controversial figures ‚ including Boston, which removed its only monument to the Confederacy, a small stone slab put up in 1963 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.Jeremy Snow, 46, a white law enforcement officer who was visiting Faneuil Hall from Florida, said he disagreed with this movement to take down historical markers.‚African-Americans were treated so wrong and so badly over the years,‚ Mr. Snow said. ‚But instead of tearing down our history, we should be making new monuments for new reasons.‚He and his family were also planning to visit Salem, Mass., scene of the 17th-century witch trials, ‚where again, people were done wrong,‚ he said.‚It seems like when people are done so wrong, it becomes history,‚ he said. ‚We shouldn‚t do away with it. We need to learn from it.‚","Boston Grapples With Faneuil Hall, Named for a Slaveholder","May 24, 2018 /  2:38 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-nascar-hall-of-fame/gordon-leads-four-other-legends-into-nascar-hall-of-fame-idUSKCN1IP0CD,"In the least surprising racing story of 2018, four-time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon was elected to the NASCAR Hall of Fame on Wednesday in his first year of eligibility.

Picture Supplied by Action ImagesBut Gordon certainly wasn’t the only worthy choice for the Class of 2019. Team owner Jack Roush, a brilliant innovator who has racked up victories and championships across a broad spectrum of motorsports, will join Gordon when the stellar class is officially ushered into the Hall on Feb. 1, 2019. Team owner Roger Penske, who fostered the Hall of Fame career of driver Rusty Wallace and won his first championship in NASCAR’s top division in 2012 with driver Brad Keselowski, will accompany his fellow Ford team owner into the Hall. Davey Allison, winner of 19 Cup races and one of the brightest stars in the sport before he succumbed to injuries sustained in a helicopter crash at Talladega in 1993, joined his father, Bobby Allison, as a member of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Alan Kulwicki, whose life was cut short by a plane crash in 1993 less than five months after he became the last driver to win the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championship as a “privateer,” was the fifth member of the Class of 2019 introduced by NASCAR Chairman and CEO Brian France. If ever there was a “lock” for the NASCAR Hall of Fame, Gordon fills that role. Winner of 93 Cup points races — third all-time behind Richard Petty (200) and David Pearson (105) and ahead of Darrell Waltrip (84), Bobby Allison (84), Cale Yarborough (83) and Jimmie Johnson (83) — Gordon drove the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet for 797 consecutive races from his debut in 1992 until he bowed out of the ride at the end of the 2015 season. Now an analyst for FOX Sports, Gordon won four Cup championships, behind only Petty, Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Sr., who share the series record with seven each. Gordon won three Daytona 500s, four straight Southern 500s and a record five Brickyard 400s in his remarkable career. “Man, I’m on cloud nine,” Gordon said during a televised interview after the announcement. He follows his long-time crew chief Ray Evernham and team owner Rick Hendrick into the Hall. “The significance of being there when Rick was inducted and being a part of it earlier this year with Ray, that’s when it really started to sink in with me about how special it would be,” said Gordon, who was named on a record 96 percent of ballots. “They dedicated their whole lives (to racing), and that’s the thing I see as a common thread of anybody that goes into the Hall of Fame. “They sacrificed everything for racing and for NASCAR, and it became their life. To be honored by going into the Hall of Fame makes it all worthwhile and makes it very, very special.” Roush, who was named on 70 percent of ballots, started his career in drag racing and sports cars but gravitated to NASCAR racing in 1988. An owner with a keen eye for talent, Roush supported the careers of such luminaries as NASCAR Hall of Famer Mark Martin, Kurt Busch, Matt Kenseth, Carl Edwards and Greg Biffle. “When we got started, I was just hoping I could stay in the sport for a while,” said Roush, who won Cup championships in 2003 with Kenseth and 2004 with Busch. “I can’t imagine that my name is up there with the 45 people that have already been inducted, with the things that they’ve accomplished. “It’s rarefied air, and I’ve got to take a while to think about what it all means to me.” In addition to the 2012 Cup championship, Team Penske has won the 2010 NASCAR Xfinity Series title and four of the last five Xfinity Series owners championships. In addition to his NASCAR accomplishments, Penske has won the Indianapolis 500 16 times as an owner. “There were many great candidates,” Penske said in a SiriusXM NASCAR Radio interview after the announcement. “This is my day, and I’ll never forget it.” Wallace was delighted for his former boss. “I don’t know of anyone that has accomplished as much across all levels of motorsports as Roger Penske,” Wallace said. “I don’t know of anyone in motorsports that is as respected among all levels of racing and business as Roger. “He’s my personal mentor and my personal hero. He has helped me immeasurably, both in racing and in business. I can’t say enough about Roger — he’s just an all-around fantastic person.” Penske was named on 68 percent of the ballots submitted by Voting Panel members. Davey and Bobby Allison, the only father/son combination to finish 1-2 in the Daytona 500, are the second father/son duo to be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, joining Ned and Dale Jarrett. “It’s was a great feeling of happiness, of weakness and everything,” Bobby Allison said of the moment when France announced his son’s name. “I just had to bend over and get a hold of myself. It was really good news.” Davey Allison received 63 percent of the vote from panel members. Kulwicki, who was named on 46 percent of ballots, rallied from a 278-point deficit to win the 1992 series title, edging Bill Elliott by 10 points — then the closest margin in Cup history — after a thrilling season finale at Atlanta in which Davey Allison also had a shot at the championship. Former NASCAR executive and newsman Jim Hunter received the 2019 Landmark Award for Outstanding Contributions to NASCAR. Known for his rapier wit and wise counsel, Hunter was instrumental in guiding the careers of an abundance of current and former NASCAR stars. After his days as sports editor of the Columbia (S.C.) Record, Hunter served as public relations director for both Darlington Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. He was later named president at Darlington and corporate vice president of International Speedway Corporation, before returning to NASCAR to lead the sport’s PR initiatives. —By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service.

Democratic Party leaders were, however, caught by surprise in the Central Valley district of Representative Jeff Denham, a Republican who easily won a place on the general election ballot.In the competition for the second spot in November, a Democrat was leading a little-known Republican candidate by less than a thousand votes.While 100 percent of the precincts were reporting vote counts in each of the contested districts, The Associated Press had not yet declared the top two finishers in some races because absentee ballots are trickling in and the gap between second and third place was narrow.But in key races, Democrats had sufficient margins to be poised to advance to November.There may be no state more crucial to Democrats‚ hopes for taking back control of the House than California. If Democrats were to win each of the seven Republican-held districts Mrs. Clinton carried, the gains would amount to nearly a third of the 23 seats they need over all to flip the House. Here is a look at the results in those seven districts:39th Congressional District Young Kim, a Republican assemblywoman in this Orange County-based district, secured a spot in the general election in November. She will face a Democrat, Gil Cisneros, a Navy veteran whom national Democrats spent heavily to help in a crowded primary race.Democrats have high hopes in this increasingly diverse district now that the veteran Representative Ed Royce is retiring. Republicans, though, are optimistic that their Korean-American nominee positions them well in a district that is filled with Asian and Hispanic voters.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee endorsed Mr. Cisneros in April and spent $2 million promoting him and attacking Republicans to keep their vote share down.And last month, state and national Democrats brokered a d√©tente between Mr. Cisneros and another party candidate, Andy Thorburn, after weeks of increasingly negative attacks between the two, who spent at least $6 million of their own money on the race. In the end, though, Mr. Cisneros significantly outpaced the other Democrats in the field, winning about 9,000 more votes than his closest party rival, Mr. Thorburn.48th Congressional District Mr. Rohrabacher was the top vote-getter in his Orange County district, while Harley Rouda and Hans Keirstead, both Democrats, were locked in an extraordinarily close race for the second slot. As of Wednesday evening, Mr. Keirstead had only 45 more votes than Mr. Rouda, with all precincts reporting but some late ballots still being tabulated.Both Democrats had over 1,000 votes more than Scott Baugh, a Republican, who had aimed to deny Democrats a chance to take on Mr. Rohrabacher in November. National Democratic groups spent heavily on the race to avoid a shutout, unleashing a series of attacks on Mr. Baugh and promoting Mr. Rouda.With his vocal support for Russia and a trail of controversial comments, Mr. Rohrabacher could be among the most vulnerable House Republicans in California this fall. Democrats in his affluent, Seal Beach-to-Laguna Beach district have been organizing against him for over a year.49th Congressional District Diane Harkey, a Republican, was the leading vote-getter in the seat currently held by Mr. Issa and appeared most likely to face a Democrat, Mike Levin, in the general election.Ms. Harkey, a former assemblywoman, ran far ahead of any other Republican in the field. Mr. Levin, an environmental attorney, had a lead of nearly 2,000 votes ahead of another Democrat, Sara Jacobs, in a seat that stretches from Camp Pendleton south to La Jolla. Democrats nearly captured this affluent district in 2016, when Mr. Issa won by fewer than 2,000 votes. With Mr. Issa retiring, the seat will be one of the Democratic Party‚s top targets in November. Mr. Levin, a former executive director of the Democratic Party of Orange County, raised less money than Ms. Jacobs, but he benefited from building a solid political organization after entering the race early in 2017, ahead of some of his rivals.National Democrats did not get behind any candidate in this race, but they did broadcast ads to drive down support for Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, a Republican. Mr. Chavez will most likely finish in a distant sixth place.But Ms. Jacobs was not ready to concede Wednesday morning, saying in a statement that ‚it‚s important that every vote be counted, and we‚re going to allow that process to continue.‚10th Congressional District Representative Jeff Denham, a Republican, was the top vote-getter and will most likely face a Democrat, Josh Harder, a venture capitalist in this heavily agricultural district in the San Joaquin Valley.But for much of the night Tuesday, Democrats were alarmed that they might be locked out of the November general election. Mr. Harder was narrowly leading a Republican candidate, Ted Howze, by about 900 votes.Mr. Harder, raising close to $1.5 million, had more money to campaign with than all the other Democratic candidates in the primary combined. But Mr. Harder was at risk of being denied a slot on the November ballot because the other five Democrats in the race split more than 30 percent of the vote. National Democrats had spent little money attempting to ensure they advanced a candidate into the general election. The district encompasses a large portion of the San Joaquin Valley, dominated by almond farms, and has been represented in Congress since 2013 by Mr. Denham. But it is not just farms that dominate economic life in the district: There is a large industrial base and a sliver of populous areas that serve as bedroom communities to the Bay Area and could offer Democrats hope in November.21st Congressional District With no Republican challengers to Representative David Valadao and only one Democrat ‚ T.J. Cox, a businessman ‚ on the ballot, the outcome of this race in the Central Valley was not much in question.Mr. Valadao, a Republican, has represented this district in California‚s Central Valley since 2013, and is seeking a fourth term. Mrs. Clinton carried seven California districts that are currently represented by Republicans, and in those districts, Mr. Valadao may be most difficult to beat.Even as Mrs. Clinton was carrying the district with more than 60 percent of the vote, Mr. Valadao easily won re-election.And while the district is over 70 percent Latino, Democrats have found it more difficult to turn out Hispanic voters in nonpresidential years.Mr. Cox, though, will have ample funding: He had more than $440,000 as of last month.25th Congressional District Representative Steve Knight, a Republican in his second term, took the top spot in this Los Angeles County-based district, while Katie Hill, a Democrat, appeared poised to claim the second slot on the November ballot.Ms. Hill, who runs a nonprofit helping homeless people, was leading another Democratic candidate, Bryan Caforio, by more than 1,500 votes on Wednesday. She was lifted by Emily‚s List, the Democratic women‚s group, over Mr. Caforio, who ran against Mr. Knight in 2016.Mr. Knight is seen as one of the most at-risk House Republicans in California because of his changing district.A former Los Angeles police officer who served for years in the California Legislature before winning a seat in Congress, Mr. Knight represents a piece of northern Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. The area had been reliably conservative, but a growing Hispanic population has raised hopes among Democrats that it can be flipped.Mrs. Clinton won the district by nearly seven points, and Democrats outnumber Republicans among registered voters.45th Congressional District Representative Mimi Walters, a Republican in her second term, was the top vote-getter in this Orange County district. She will face a Democrat, Katie Porter, who is a consumer advocate and law professor. A strong progressive candidate, Ms. Porter was propelled by key endorsements from Senators Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as Emily‚s List.In her career in California‚s Legislature and in Congress, Ms. Walters has proved resilient. And she has nearly $1.6 million on hand. But Ms. Porter is likely to draw deep support from her allies in the national party in a district Mrs. Clinton carried by more than five points and that is increasingly made up of Asian and Hispanic voters.",Democrats Find Relief in California House Race Results,"June 1, 2018 /  6:38 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-primary-california/bumpy-road-for-california-democrats-targeting-republican-house-seats-idUSKCN1IX5NT,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - As Californians prepare to go to the polls on Tuesday to choose candidates in primary elections, the state’s quirky electoral rules and a softening of support for Democrats among suburban voters could disrupt the party’s ambitious plan to wrest as many as 10 seats from Republicans in California.  November’s general election could change the balance of power in the U.S. Congress, where Republicans control both chambers. Democrats need to win 23 seats nationwide to have a majority in the House of Representatives, considered a very real possibility. Most of California’s congressional districts did not go for the Republican Party’s leader, Donald Trump, in the 2016 presidential election.  “It’s the first time in years that California elections have mattered in national politics,” said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University Los Angeles. “The House races are critically important.” Voters on Tuesday will also be choosing candidates to run in next November’s election in primaries in New Jersey, Mississippi, Alabama, Iowa, Montana, South Dakota and New Mexico. The California Republican party’s biggest problem is a continuing decline across the state that began decades ago.    For the first time, the number of registered voters who are Republicans slipped below the number of independents, leaving the party in third place, said Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data www.politicaldata.com, which analyzed registration information from the state this week.  But that decline does not give the Democratic Party an easy win on Tuesday. The party has its own challenges. If voters select Democratic candidates who are too progressive for conservative areas of California, it might prove difficult for Democrats to win in November. Yet if more moderate candidates win in the primaries, fired-up progressives may decide not to vote in November, leaving more room for Republicans to win. ""The Democrats have their work cut out for them,"" said Mark Baldassare, who runs the Public Policy Institute of California www.ppic.org, a polling and public policy think tank. ""Some of the exuberance about Democrats taking this over has maybe gotten a little bit ahead of itself.""  So many enthusiastic newcomers have tossed their hats in the ring in an effort to unseat vulnerable incumbent Republicans or to claim seats vacated by resigning Republicans that they may simply divide the anti-Trump vote among themselves.  That dilution of the vote matters more in California because of its so-called jungle primary. It does not hold separate party primaries. Instead, the top two vote-getters advance to the general election regardless of party. For example, in the 48th Congressional District, which includes affluent coastal towns between Los Angeles and San Diego, 16 candidates will appear on Tuesday’s ballot. Five Republicans, eight Democrats, a Libertarian and an independent have filed papers to challenge Republican Representative Dana Rohrbacher. One of the Republican challengers, former State Assemblyman Scott Baugh, is considered well known enough to possibly make it into the second position after Rohrabacher, a situation that would lock Democrats out of the race. Key to the Democrats’ efforts is suburban Orange County south of Los Angeles, where four congressional districts were once the heart of rock-ribbed California Republicanism. In all four districts, some of which include parts of San Diego and Los Angeles counties, voters in 2016 chose Hillary Clinton over Trump for president, but returned Republicans to Congress. Two representatives, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce, chose not to run for re-election this year. Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters are seeking re-election in competitive races. Many voters in those districts are affluent and suburban, a group that has been leaning toward choosing Democrats for Congress in November, according to recent Reuters polling. Orange County is more ethnically diverse than in the past, a change that generally leads to more support for Democrats. But Reuters/Ipsos polling over four weeks in May shows a softening at the national level of support for Democrats for Congress among suburban voters. And the Public Policy Institute's May survey of likely voters showed that most likely voters in the 10 Republican-held California districts viewed as very close by the Cook Political Report here were supporting Republicans for Congress. State Republican Party Chairman Jim Brulte said the polls and a strong presence in early voting indicate Republicans in the state are becoming more engaged as the election approaches, possibly alleviating a so-called enthusiasm gap he had feared would keep Republican voters at home.  “Based on what we’re seeing now, my concerns have been allayed,” Brulte said.   Absentee ballots received so far show Republicans punching above their weight, accounting for 34 percent of ballots returned even though they only amount to 26 percent of registered voters, according to Political Data.

Republican voters also chose strong candidates in Southern California for the showdown in November.The Democrats had more on the line, and more to celebrate. They will be able to mount challenges in places where the party feared being shut out, including open seats near San Diego and Los Angeles and districts represented by Republican incumbents in Orange County, Los Angeles County and around Modesto. Between California and New Jersey, Democrats will contend for at least 10 Republican-held seats, nearly half of the 23 they need for control.While California was the focal point of Tuesday‚s voting, New Jersey was one of a handful of other states where the battle for the House was also joined, including Iowa and New Mexico.In New Jersey, Democrats settled on well-funded candidates who they believe are likely to prevail in elections for seats being vacated by Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank A. LoBiondo. They also intend to mount serious challenges to two incumbents, Leonard Lance and Tom MacArthur, the latter a lawmaker who has closely aligned himself with President Trump. ‚The results last night not only in California but in New Jersey, Iowa and New Mexico ultimately come down to really strong Democratic candidates getting through with pretty overwhelming support in states where the voters weren‚t split among multiple candidates,‚ said Meredith Kelly, the communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Republicans saw some positive developments Tuesday as well. In the California governor‚s race, John Cox, a Republican, secured a spot on the ballot to face Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor.In an early-morning tweet Wednesday, Mr. Trump embraced Mr. Cox and tried to counter the widely prevailing view that Democrats had dodged an electoral bullet.‚Great night for Republicans! Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California. He can win,‚ Mr. Trump tweeted. ‚So much for the big Blue Wave, it may be a big Red Wave. Working hard!‚In addition, congressional Republicans were enthusiastic about their own contenders in California, including Young Kim, a Korean-American woman who was the top vote-getter in the primary to replace Representative Ed Royce, another retiring Republican in a district that is nearly 30 percent Asian.‚As a businesswoman and a longtime aide to Congressman Ed Royce, Young understands Southern California families‚ needs,‚ said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.Another female candidate, Diane Harkey, was the top vote-getter in the San Diego County district being vacated by Representative Darrell Issa. While Democrats managed to push their candidates through the dicey process, their success in the California races is not guaranteed even though at least seven Republican-held districts in play were carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016. Despite opposition to Mr. Trump, the districts remain dominated by Republican voters. And Democrats did not always get their preferred candidate, with more progressive challengers prevailing in some districts. For instance, Democratic voters in Orange County picked Katie Porter, a law professor and strong progressive candidate, over the more business-oriented Dave Min to face Representative Mimi Walters, a Republican in her second term, in November. Orange County, south of Los Angeles, is undergoing a demographic transformation as Asian and Latino migrants settle in what was once a pillar of the Ronald Reagan-era Republican Party. But while some suburban voters there may be uneasy with Mr. Trump, the county is hardly a bastion of liberalism.‚I‚m not convinced that voters are going to punish Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrabacher because they don‚t like the president,‚ said Mr. Gonzales, referring to two California Republican incumbents at risk.Democrats, though, vowed to use Ms. Walters‚s support for the tax overhaul against her, noting that the cutbacks on mortgage interest and state and local tax deductions had hit many in the affluent district.‚We‚re going to go right at Walters for voting to raise taxes on half of the homeowners in her district,‚ said Sean Clegg, a California-based strategist for Ms. Porter.Democrats were threatened by an embarrassment of riches in California arising from a strong backlash against Mr. Trump. The environment created a golden opportunity to win a seat in Congress, and the prospect attracted so many contenders in some cases that the party feared the candidates would divide the vote and open the door to Republicans winning the top two slots.‚House Democrats were braced for a rough night in California that would steepen their climb to the majority,‚ said former Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat who previously ran his party‚s House campaign arm. ‚Instead, they had a good night that further clears their path.‚ Democratic strategists in Washington deserve some credit for their efforts to knock down the biggest threats in California. In some instances, they picked Democratic candidates who were not supported by Emily‚s List, the political action committee that backs women who support abortion rights, and in others they split with the state party. National Democrats also pumped in money to knock down a second-tier Republican, clearing the field for Democrats to fight it out for second place.‚This confirmed that being proactive in these races could yield the results that we wanted,‚ said Representative Judy Chu, Democrat of California.For example, the House Majority PAC, the main Democratic ‚super PAC,‚ unveiled an advertisement in the last weeks against Scott Baugh, a Republican running in the district represented by Mr. Rohrabacher. The super PAC understood that it could not take out Mr. Rohrabacher, but it needed to make sure the badly divided Democratic candidates would not leave the November ballot open for him.And in the seat held by Mr. Issa, who is retiring, the House campaign arm recognized that a moderate Republican assemblyman, Rocky Ch√°vez, posed a threat and unleashed an ad campaign that attacked him from the right as part of an attempt to drive his fellow Republicans away from him. It worked: Mr. Chavez appeared likely to finish in sixth place, and Democrats were three of the top four vote-getters in the district.In the end, the D.C.C.C. and a pair of Democratic political action committees working jointly, the House Majority PAC and Priorities USA Action, spent over $7 million to knock down Republican candidates and lift their own contenders in three districts: Mr. Rohrabacher‚s, Mr. Issa‚s and Mr. Royce‚s. In all three, a second Republican faded in the final results.At the same time, the D.C.C.C. backed Gil Cisneros over the chosen Emily‚s List candidate, Mai Khanh Tran, in Mr. Royce‚s district, figuring a Navy veteran and Latino had a better shot than an immigrant pediatrician in a district that has been represented by a Republican for years. Ultimately, three women backed by Emily‚s List in targeted districts ‚ Ms. Tran, Virginia Madue√±o and Sara Jacobs ‚ appeared to have lost to men. Even if they had been shut out of some of the California contests, Democrats still would have had a national path to winning the two dozen seats needed to take over the House in January. But being frozen out of races in winnable Republican-held districts would have been a major disappointment for Democrats and could have sapped some of the enthusiasm they will need to generate over the coming months.‚Democrats have to be happy and relieved,‚ said Dave Wasserman, House race analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ‚They have woken up from their nightmare of lockouts, and everything is O.K.‚The Democratic success could affect activity in Congress. Faced with the need to protect endangered Republican incumbents in California, House Republican leaders may determine that they have to move forward with a vote on immigration policy being demanded by Republican centrists who believe the issue is critical to their campaigns.",Democrats Strengthen House Takeover Prospects in Primary Voting,"June 6, 2018 /  4:34 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election/democratic-hopes-for-house-control-buoyed-by-voting-results-idUSKCN1J228O,"SACRAMENTO, Calif./PRINCETON, N.J. (Reuters) - U.S. Democrats on Wednesday said the results of nominating contests in California and New Jersey put them in a stronger position to gain control of Congress in November and oppose Republican President Donald Trump. The morning after the busiest day of the primary election season, when voters in eight states picked candidates for the November election, California Democrats ensured they would have a chance of winning back some of the 10 Republican-held U.S. House of Representatives seats they are targeting. California is key to Democrats’ hopes of gaining a majority in the 435-seat House, which would require flipping 23 seats. A Democrat-controlled House would likely stall much of Trump’s policy agenda and could lend strength to any potential effort to impeach Trump if Democrats decide grounds exist, either by virtue of the ongoing probe into Russian election interference by special counsel Robert Mueller or other reasons. “As we await final results in multiple districts, it is clear that Democrats are in a stronger position than ever to take back the House, and winning districts in California will be central to that path,” said Tyler Law, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in a Wednesday email. But solid turnout by Republican voters on Tuesday underscored the challenges Democrats will face in trying to win in the conservative areas like suburbs of Los Angeles and Sacramento, as well as in rural areas that supported Trump in the presidential election two years ago. “Great night for Republicans!” Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “So much for the big Blue Wave, it may be a big Red Wave. Working hard!” Republicans control the Senate by a two-seat majority, but political analysts see Democrats as having a weaker chance of turning the balance of power there since they must defend a bevy of seats in Republican-leaning rural states including Indiana, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia. FIGHT GOES ON IN CALIFORNIA California saw an unusually large number of Democrats vying for office, many energized by anger over Trump administration policies restricting immigration and abortion access as well as easing environmental regulations. The large field could have undercut the party’s chances for success since the state’s system for choosing candidates allows the two top vote-getters to advance to the general election regardless of party. Splitting of the Democratic vote could have led to two Republicans running in the general election.

REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonMost other U.S. states have rules allowing one candidate from each party into the general election. Democrats had eight candidates on the ballot in the race to unseat Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher, who has served in Congress since 1989 and was re-elected in 2016 in a southern California district that also chose Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. Harley Rouda, a real estate executive and first-time congressional candidate with the support of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, looked poised to challenge Rohrabacher based on state election data. Democrat and venture capital executive Josh Harder held a narrow edge in a central California district over Republican Ted Howze, a long-time local government official. Harder or Howze will challenge four-term incumbent Republican Jeff Denham. California Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox won a chance to face Democrat Gavin Newsom in November. Analysts saw that as a positive for the Republican Party, reasoning that not having a candidate on the ballot for governor could have diminished turnout among party supporters. NATIONALLY BACKED DEMOCRATS PREVAIL Candidates backed by the national Democratic Party succeeded in winning spots on the November ballot in eight races in New Jersey, California, Iowa and New Mexico. Results for the ninth candidate, Rouda, were not final early on Wednesday. Those candidates included four  New Jersey moderates who had faced more liberal challengers. Women Democrats won spots on the November ballot in key House races in Iowa, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico, continuing a trend that began earlier this year.

Sitting nearly still, Mrs. Trump cut a totemic figure alongside Mr. Trump as they sat around a conference table at the agency‚s headquarters.The president, reading from a notecard, introduced ‚our great first lady‚ to several members of his cabinet, Vice President Mike Pence and an assembled group of reporters.‚She went through a little rough patch, but she‚s doing great,‚ Mr. Trump said, patting his wife on the hand. ‚The people love you. Thank you, honey.‚ Mrs. Trump spent five days at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in May to treat what her aides called a benign kidney condition, and had not appeared in public since before entering the hospital.On Twitter Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump bitterly complained about the speculation by the public and some journalists about her absence. But in attacking what he said were several conspiracy theories the news media had generated about his wife‚s absence, he ended up repeating the kind of unfounded rumors about his wife that would normally attract legal action from him and his notoriously litigious family.‚The Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great first lady, Melania,‚ wrote the president, who has long reveled in conspiracy theories. ‚During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia, to abuse. All Fake, she is doing really well!‚By attacking journalists who have speculated or asked questions about his wife, the president put himself at odds with his own personal history of using his platform ‚ and a number of his supporters ‚ to target women and effectively amplify rumors about their health, appearance and personal relationships.On the campaign trail, he repeatedly attacked Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, suggesting that she was not ‚loyal‚ to her husband, President Bill Clinton; questioning her physical stamina for the job; and suggesting that she was mentally ill. Mr. Trump‚s campaign also aired at least one TV ad that pointed to conspiracy theories about Mrs. Clinton‚s health. And he later took aim at two female journalists ‚ Megyn Kelly and Mika Brzezinski ‚ describing them in pejorative terms. He said that he once saw Ms. Brzezinski at a gathering at his Florida estate ‚bleeding badly from a face-lift‚ and that she had a ‚low I.Q.‚In Mrs. Trump‚s case, the White House has insisted that she is entitled to the same privacy that would shield any other patient.She surfaced for the first time on Tuesday in a closed White House event, but was spotted around the White House last week. Apparently referring to this, the president said on Twitter that reporters had seen the first lady ‚merrily‚ strolling in the White House over the past week, but ‚never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever. Fake News is really bad!‚But at least one reporter noted on Twitter that he had seen the first lady with her aides in the White House, and her office has said Mrs. Trump has taken several internal meetings during her recovery. With the White House declining to issue updates on the first lady‚s recovery, the guesswork about her whereabouts and her health expanded beyond the news media: On Tuesday, as Mrs. Trump attended the event with Gold Star families, a contingent of observers on Twitter wondered whether the sparse footage captured of the event was indeed from that day.Historians say no modern first lady has prized her privacy more than Mrs. Trump, but the timing of Mrs. Trump‚s departure from the public eye was abrupt and baffling: It came as she was ramping up her public appearances and in the midst of rolling out her official platform, ‚Be Best,‚ which will focus on children‚s issues. Mrs. Trump‚s stay in the hospital was also shrouded in secrecy. In the hours after her procedure, aides wore scrubs around her but said the procedure had been successful and without complications.In any case, the first lady‚s public re-emergence is tied to one of her interests. Stephanie Grisham, her communications director, said in an email that Mrs. Trump would be attending the hurricane briefing because ‚it is an issue that she cares very much about.‚Last year, the first lady and her husband traveled to Puerto Rico to visit families affected by hurricanes, serving them food and visiting relief centers.When asked about the first lady‚s health, Ms. Grisham‚s response was brief.‚She feels great,‚ Ms. Grisham wrote, ‚doing well.‚At the FEMA briefing, Mrs. Trump did not speak publicly, but listened, smiling at her husband and nodding as he spoke. As the event drew to a close, the president referred to his wife and Mr. Pence.‚Speaking for Melania and Mike,‚ Mr. Trump said, ‚we thank you all very much.‚",Melania Trump Appears in Public After ‚Äòa Little Rough Patch‚Äô,"June 6, 2018 /  2:30 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-tweet/trump-on-twitter-mitch-mcconnell-john-cox-melania-trump-idUSKCN1J21VF,"The following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS.

Otero will rule on the request later. In imposing the stay, the judge cited the potential overlap between Daniels’ lawsuit and a separate criminal probe by federal prosecutors in Manhattan that he said could result in Cohen’s indictment. Daniels is suing to end an agreement under which Cohen paid her $130,000 not to discuss an alleged intimate relationship she had with Trump beginning in 2006 and continuing in 2007. Her lawsuit also includes a claim that Cohen defamed her by implying that she had lied about her relationship with Trump. The president has denied having sex with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Avenatti posted Otero’s order on his Twitter feed, without discussing its substance. Otero has yet to rule on Cohen’s bid for a restraining order to stop Avenatti from maligning him, in a “seemingly unquenchable thirst for publicity” that has included dozens of television appearances and hundreds of tweets.

The filing also said Avenatti had publicized information about Cohen’s financial transactions that was “accurate” but had “no lawful source.” The New Yorker reported on Wednesday that a law enforcement official had leaked financial records relating to Cohen. “Mr Avenatti appears to be primarily focused on smearing Mr Cohen publicly in his efforts to further his own interest in garnering as much media attention as possible,” Cohen’s lawyers said in the filing. They said Avenatti had appeared on national television and talked about Cohen 147 times in the past 10 weeks, sometimes making inaccurate statements. Avenatti in an email called Cohen’s filing “baseless,” but said he was “pleased they admit the factual accuracy of what we previously disclosed.” Avenatti has publicly discussed transactions between Cohen and companies including drugmaker Novartis AG (NOVN.S) and Columbus Nova LLC, a New York-based investment firm linked to Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg. The case before Wood concerns authorities’ search of documents from Cohen’s home and office as part of a criminal investigation. Wood has appointed a special master to review the documents to identify those that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. The investigation into Cohen stems in part from a referral from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia. Trump has denied any collusion.

It is unclear how many of them are exhibiting symptoms, but a State Department spokeswoman said Wednesday evening that ‚a number of individuals‚ had been sent to the United States for further testing.For months, American officials have been worried that their diplomats have been subjected to targeted attacks involving odd sounds, leading to symptoms similar to those ‚following concussion or minor traumatic brain injury,‚ the State Department says.The cases in China have broadened a medical mystery that started in 2016, when American Embassy employees and their family members began falling ill in Havana. In all, 24 of them were stricken with headaches, nausea, hearing loss, cognitive issues and other symptoms after saying they heard odd sounds. The issue has roiled relations with Cuba, which immediately fell under suspicion, and led the United States to expel Cuban diplomats. But with Americans now exhibiting similar symptoms in Guangzhou, American officials have raised suspicions about whether other countries, perhaps China or Russia, might be to blame. That is sure to complicate already strained relations with both countries over a variety of economic, political and security issues. Russia has been accused of meddling in the 2016 American presidential election, trade disputes have erupted with China and American officials fear that the Chinese are undermining relations with North Korea ahead of a summit meeting with President Trump planned for next week.The new illnesses in China come just weeks after American officials reported finding their first case here in Guangzhou, where a consulate employee got sick. Some American officials in this city live in apartment complexes filled with other foreigners and wealthy Chinese; that is where the ailing employees were subjected to unusual noises.But it remains unclear whether the illnesses are the result of attacks at all. Other theories have included toxins, listening devices that accidentally emitted harmful sounds or even mass hysteria. The mystery spread to China this spring, when the first employee fell ill, and fears escalated last month when the government warned other employees to seek medical attention if they experienced unusual ailments. So far this week, another employee, his wife and their two children were evacuated after the parents exhibited neurological symptoms. Officials said they expected that at least some others would be flown out of the country as well.The illnesses appear more widespread than the State Department initially reported last month, when it said that one person had ‚reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.‚  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the symptoms of the first American employee in Guangzhou to report being ill ‚are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba.‚ There are roughly 170 American diplomats or employees in Guangzhou, as well as their family members, and a senior American official said a sizable number had undergone or would soon undergo testing by the State Department doctors who arrived on May 31.The officials cautioned that no final determination had been made about what caused the illnesses.The latest American employee evacuated from Guangzhou is Mark A. Lenzi, a security engineering officer at the consulate. He left Wednesday evening with his wife and two children after having suffered in recent months from what he described in an interview as neurological symptoms.On Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo said in a statement that the symptoms in the first case discovered in Guangzhou were similar to the ones experienced by the 24 Americans who became ill in Havana. He said that the cause had not yet been established. The injuries in Cuba, like those in China, followed disturbing sensations of sounds and vibrations that have been described variously as the noises made by cicadas, static, metal sheets waving or, in Mr. Lenzi‚s case, marbles rolling around a metal funnel.After the injuries were diagnosed in Cuba, the Trump administration expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, saying Cuban officials had failed to adequately protect American diplomats. The Cuban government denied any involvement and questioned whether any ‚attacks‚ had taken place. American officials suggested it was too soon to consider such a response in China, though they have raised it with the Chinese government.On May 23, the State Department disclosed that an employee stationed in China had complained of ‚subtle and vague, but abnormal sensations of sound and pressure‚ over several months from late 2017 until April. That employee, who was evacuated, was not identified.‚We are not aware of any similar situations in China, either inside or outside of the diplomatic community,‚ the department said in the health alert. It advised others with ‚concerns about any symptoms or medical problems‚ to consult a doctor.The disclosure caused anxiety and anger among American government employees in China. Others have since come forward to report similar experiences or symptoms. In a statement on Wednesday evening, the State Department‚s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said that ‚a number of individuals‚ had been sent to the United States for further testing and that the medical examinations continued in Guangzhou. Among those who reported symptoms was Mr. Lenzi. In an email sent to the entire staff of the consulate, he complained that the first employee was evacuated in April, but that no one was told of the health concerns until a month later ‚ after doctors in the United States had found evidence of brain trauma. The initial health alert, he said in an interview, suggested it was an isolated case. ‚They knew full well it wasn‚t,‚ he said.The consulate, which opened in 2013, is a state-of-the-art building designed to withstand electronic eavesdropping and other security and intelligence threats.In an interview before leaving China, Mr. Lenzi said that he had lived in the same apartment tower as the officer evacuated in April. It is one of several high-rise buildings in The Canton Place, a modern complex built around a plaza and bordered by restaurants, cafes and galleries. Another diplomat who reported symptoms was at a different upscale building near the consulate.Mr. Lenzi said that over the past year he and his wife had experienced similar physical symptoms, including headaches, sleeplessness and nausea, and on three or four occasions they heard odd noises, though they did not put them together until the disclosures last month.Even if people are evacuated for further tests, that does not necessarily mean that they have suffered injuries or illnesses, the officials emphasized. Only 25 percent of those evacuated from Cuba, for example, were later found to have health problems. But the Chinese cases have raised alarms inside the State Department. Now led by Mr. Pompeo, the department appears eager to avoid the criticism it faced over what some called its handling of the Cuba cases.In addition to the department‚s medical team, William E. Todd, the acting director general of the Foreign Service, and Michael T. Evanoff, the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, flew to Guangzhou to assess the situation. Their visit was not announced in advance, and they were not made available to comment before departing on Wednesday.In Tuesday‚s statement, Mr. Pompeo said he had created a health care task force to examine ‚the unexplained health incidents that have affected a number of U.S. government personnel and family members stationed overseas.‚The statement left open the possibility that there have been similar events at other American embassies or consulates. One American official said that he was aware of reports of isolated episodes, but that there did not appear to be any discernible pattern.Guangzhou is a major commercial hub of 14 million people on the Pearl River, about 75 miles north of Hong Kong. In addition to the embassy in Beijing and the consulates in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, the United States operates consulates in Chengdu, Shanghai, Shenyang and Wuhan.Mr. Lenzi worked for the diplomatic security department, and he believes that his work could have made him a target. Before joining the Foreign Service in 2011, he worked with the International Republican Institute, funded by Congress, promoting democratic reforms in Ukraine and Georgia ‚ two countries where Russia has denounced American involvement.",U.S. Diplomats Evacuated in China as Medical Mystery Grows,"June 10, 2018 /  5:18 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa/cuba-says-cause-of-illness-in-u-s-diplomats-remains-a-mystery-idUSKBN1J60V6,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba said on Sunday it remained baffled by health issues affecting U.S. diplomats, after the U.S. State Department reported two Cuba-based functionaries had symptoms similar to previous cases that began in late 2016. A vintage car passes by in front of the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, January 12, 2017. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini The State Department said on Friday the cases were similar to those of 24 diplomats and family members taken ill through 2017, leading to a drawdown of personnel in Havana to a skeleton staff and the expulsion of 17 Cuban diplomats from Washington.  The United States also issued a travel warning for its citizens. Sunday’s foreign ministry statement termed those actions politically motivated, pointing out that “after more than a year of investigations by Cuba and the United States ... there are no credible hypotheses nor scientific conclusions that justify the actions taken by the U.S. government against Cuba.” The statement said Cuba was informed of one case in late May where “a functionary of the (U.S.) embassy on the 27th of the same month had reported health symptoms as a result of ‘undefined sounds’ in her residence.” The statement said an exhaustive search of the area around the residence had turned up nothing out of the ordinary and its specialists had been denied access to the functionary. Cuba said it remained ready to work with the United States to determine what, if anything, was causing the illnesses after its own investigation had uncovered no evidence of foul play. U.S. experts have yet to determine who or what is behind the mysterious illnesses. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has partly rolled back a detente with Cuba, first charged diplomats were the victims of “sonic attacks” and Cuba as the host country was at a minimum responsible for their safety. Symptoms suffered by the diplomats have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with “mild traumatic brain injury,” State Department officials have said. In April, Canada, whose personnel were also stricken, said it would remove families of diplomats posted at its embassy in Cuba as information from medical specialists has raised concerns of a new type of brain injury.  The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday it has brought a group of diplomats home from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering from a mysterious malady that resembles a brain injury and has already affected U.S. personnel in Cuba.

The ruling by the European Union‚s highest court left the final decision to judges in the German city of Hamburg.Europe has been here before. The region strictly polices what food can be called and what ingredients can go into certain well-known dishes. European Union officials even provoked anger when they tried to tell Belgians how to cook frites, a local variation of French fries that have been made in the country for generations.Countries in Europe zealously guard their gastronomic heritage, and the European Union itself maintains a list of ‚protected‚ dishes and drinks from various parts of the region. Even the use of generic terms like milk and cream is regulated. As a result, cases like the battle over the use of the word ‚glen‚ are far from unusual.Cheesy RulingsEurope is particularly protective of its cheeses.In 2008, the European Court of Justice decided that even in translation, ‚Parmesan‚ was so evocative of the hard cheese, known in Italy as Parmigiano-Reggiano, that it would not allow cheese made elsewhere to be labeled Parmesan.That is not the only such example. In Europe, ‚feta‚ can be used only to refer to the crumbly Greek product. As a result, cheese makers in northern England that offer a feta alternative have to market it as ‚fettle.‚The consequences of such decisions extend beyond Europe.China agreed last year to respect Europe‚s food protection rules (including for feta). The regulations have, however, led to some bitterness during trade talks between the European Union and United States. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsinite, insisted on his state‚s right to make feta, prompting a Greek lawmaker to bemoan the ‚risk of mass imports of counterfeit feta into the E.U.‚ Irregular IngredientsThe region‚s highest court has also had to wade into the sticky issue of recipes, and how companies are allowed to label their products.ImageGlen Buchenbach whiskey produced by the German distiller Waldhornbrennerei prompted the Scotch Whisky Association to go to court.CreditWaldhornbrennereiLast year, the European Court of Justice decided that labels such as  ‚milk,‚ ‚butter‚ and ‚cheese‚ must have ingredients derived from animal products. That means a German company that sells dairy alternatives like ‚Soyatoo tofu butter‚ should not use the term ‚butter‚ while marketing its wares.And in 2003, the court ended the so-called chocolate wars by deciding which products were worthy of being called chocolate. Officials in Spain and Italy had forced countries like Britain and Denmark to relabel their items as ‚chocolate substitutes‚ because they included vegetable fats other than cocoa butter. But the court eventually decided that this was an impediment to the free movement of goods.Drinks and desserts are included in the regulations, too. In December, the European Court of Justice ruled that a German discounter was allowed to sell its ‚Champagner Sorbet‚ against the wishes of Champagne producers, who have been fiercely protective of their luxury brand ‚ but only if the retailer could prove that Champagne was a distinct part of the flavor.A Tall OrderIn the case of Glen Buchenbach, the ruling focused more on how liberally companies can use words in their marketing than on how the product is made.Scotch whisky is protected under rules on geographic identifiers, which require that the term can be used only for whisky made in Scotland that fulfills specific production criteria, like being matured for three years and having flavorings or sweeteners. The term ‚glen,‚ a Gaelic word that means ‚narrow valley,‚ is not specifically included in that protection.Still, the Scotch Whisky Association has been vigilant in trying to protect its brand and reputation, and so took the maker of Glen Buchenbach, a small German distiller called Waldhornbrennerei, to court. It argued that by using the term ‚glen,‚ the German company had infringed on the protected status of Scotch whisky. Consumers could be misled by the use of ‚glen‚ into thinking that the spirit came from Scotland, rather than southwest Germany, it argued.J√ºrgen Klotz, whose family owns and runs the German distillery, said that the name was a pun on Berglen, the town where the distiller is based. Buchenbach is the local river near that town.‚If you have a look around our landscape in Berglen, there are a lot of glens,‚ Mr. Klotz said.The onus now shifts to a court in Hamburg, where the Scotch Whisky Association must prove its case.It faces a tall order, lawyers said.‚The consumer would immediately have to have the image of the Scotch whisky in its mind,‚ said Anthonia Ghalamkarizadeh, a specialist in intellectual property in Hamburg for the law firm Hogan Lovells, ‚without any detours or thought process.‚",Whisky From a German Glen?

FILE PHOTO - Single malt whisky is seen in Edinburgh, Scotland May 2, 2014.  REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett The European Court of Justice took no final view, referring a complaint from the Scotch Whisky Association back to German judges to make a ruling. But in answering the Hamburg court’s query, it offered guidance to assess whether Michael Klotz’s canny branding overstepped EU law on protected regional labels. “Scotch Whisky” can only be sold in the European Union if it is actually made in Scotland, for which the spirit is the biggest international export earner. Klotz’s “Swabian Single Malt Whisky”, distilled near Stuttgart, is labeled as made in Germany. But the Scots argued that the use of the Gaelic term “glen” — a valley — could mislead buyers to think it Scotch. The ECJ said the German court must decide whether the “average European consumer” would indeed make that error. It stressed that it was not enough for the word “glen” to evoke some kind of association with Scotland. It must actually bring to mind Scotch whisky. But it did not matter, the court added, that the label said the product was made in Germany. As with many of Europe’s hundreds of protected geographical designations, such as France’s Champagne sparkling wine or Parmesan cheese from Italy, Scottish distillers are fiercely vigilant of their branding — whisky accounts for 20 percent of British food and drink exports and some 40,000 jobs. However, Britain’s imminent departure from the EU next year has raised some questions about those protections. In principle, London and Brussels say they hope to continue recognizing each other’s labeling rules but negotiations are still going on.

19973831,2542,['2018-06-07t19:07:43.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/health/blood-test-pregnancy-prematurity.html,"Scientists have developed an inexpensive blood test to predict a pregnant woman‚s due date and possibly identify women who are at risk of giving birth prematurely. The research, which is still preliminary and involved small numbers of women, was led by a prominent pioneer in the field of genetic blood testing, Stephen Quake at Stanford University, who said the test could eventually provide a low-cost method of gauging the gestational age of a developing fetus. The test, which detects changes in RNA circulating in a pregnant woman‚s blood, estimated due dates within two weeks in nearly half the cases, making it as accurate as the current, more expensive method, ultrasound, and more accurate than guesses based on a woman‚s last menstrual period. Using a similar analysis of RNA in blood from eight women who delivered prematurely, the researchers were able to correctly classify six of their pregnancies as preterm. If much larger studies achieve comparable results, the test could become a tool to help prevent unnecessary induction of labor or Cesarean deliveries, and could possibly help save babies would have died because they were born too early.  Premature birth is the leading cause of newborn death in the United States. And 15 million babies a year are born prematurely around the world.‚I think it‚s really a very exciting study that suggests an approach that may have a lot of potential for predicting preterm delivery,‚ said Dr. Louis Muglia, director of the Center for Prevention of Preterm Birth at Cincinnati Children‚s Hospital Medical Center at the University of Cincinnati. ‚It can certainly help you understand where the baby is in maturity,‚ he said, which could aid doctors in gauging when to deliver babies of women who go into unexpected early labor. In the study, published Thursday in the journal Science, the team, which was co-led by Dr. Mads Melbye, who runs the Statens Serum Institute in Denmark, analyzed the blood of 31 Danish women taken every week throughout their pregnancies, which were all full-term. The researchers studied genes linked to the placenta, the maternal immune system and the fetal liver, and found nine of those genes produce RNA signals that change distinctly as pregnancy progresses. ‚RNA is what‚s happening in the cells at any given moment,‚ said Dr. Quake, who is also co-president of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which funded the study, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others. ‚We had this idea that we could make a molecular clock to see how these things change over time and it should allow you to measure gestational age and see where things are in pregnancy.‚Dr. Quake, who invented the first noninvasive prenatal blood test for Down syndrome, said the relevant genes for gestational age were in the placenta, and the test‚s predictions were most reliable in the second and third trimester.  The researchers then applied the test to two groups of women at risk for preterm birth ‚ patients at the University of Pennsylvania who had premature contractions and patients at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who had delivered prematurely in a previous pregnancy. The gestational age blood test did not do a great job of predicting which women would deliver prematurely, suggesting those particular genes ‚may not account for the various outlier physiological events that may lead to preterm birth,‚ the study said. But in analyzing the blood of some of the women who delivered prematurely, the team identified seven other genes, mostly from the women, with RNA signals that seemed to characterize preterm birth. Dr. Quake said the team is developing plans for a large clinical trial in the general population. Dr. Diana Bianchi, director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and an expert in prenatal genetic testing, said a trial should involve as much diversity as possible. She noted that the genes relevant for estimating gestational age were identified using healthy Caucasian Danish women with full-term pregnancies. The women in the preterm birth analysis were African-American, and they represented only two of many potential risk categories for premature delivery, which can also be caused by infection, inflammation, maternal stress and other factors, she said. ‚The strength of the study is showing there are molecular milestones that are achieved by the fetus and by the placenta,‚ she said. And while the blood test is unlikely to replace ultrasound, which provides other important information, ‚I think it will add another dimension to identifying high-risk pregnancies.‚To Dr. Edith Cheng, a professor of maternal-fetal medicine and medical genetics at the University of Washington, the study‚s real significance is that it ‚cracked the door a little bit into potentially finding out how a fetus talks to the mother, what makes a pregnancy go.‚ It is almost as though the molecular message being sent by RNA ‚is a little bus that travels back and forth and is letting Mom know what‚s going on,‚ Dr. Cheng said. ‚I bet you they‚re going to find that the mother‚s going to respond. There‚s a conversation going on. That‚s what‚s cool.‚ ",Blood Test Might Predict Pregnancy Due Date and Preterm Birth,"June 13, 2018 /  7:42 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pregnancy-rna-test/experimental-blood-tests-predict-week-of-pregnancy-and-preterm-birth-risk-idUSKBN1J92WC,"(Reuters Health) - Women could soon know how far along they are in pregnancy and their risk of premature delivery using simple blood tests, researchers say. Based on fetal genetic material known as RNA circulating in a mother’s bloodstream, the tests can predict how much time is left in a pregnancy with about the same accuracy and lower cost than current methods, the study team reports in the journal Science. “We have made a discovery on an important problem - but this is just the beginning of the story, as our work needs to be validated in a large (clinical trial) before it becomes medically useful,” senior study author Stephen R. Quake of Stanford University in California told Reuters Health in an email.  Ultrasound, combined with a woman’s estimate of her last menstrual period, is typically used to estimate the week of pregnancy, which is also the so-called gestational age of the fetus. But the scans can be expensive and this method does not say anything about the odds of a preterm birth, the study authors note. A normal pregnancy lasts about 39 to 40 weeks, and births after 37 weeks’ gestational age are considered full term. Millions of births worldwide occur earlier than this, the researchers write, and preterm birth is the leading cause of newborn death as well as later health problems for these infants. Quake’s team previously showed that expectant mothers’ blood contains free-floating RNA molecules, each one a transcript of genes that are active in both fetus and mother, and that the types and amounts of these molecules changed over the course of pregnancy.  In the current pilot study, they found that a combination of only nine RNAs could accurately predict the time remaining until delivery for both first-time mothers and women who had previously given birth.  The blood test’s accuracy, within 14 days of the actual gestational age at delivery, was similar to that of ultrasound measurements. An added benefit is that the blood test, unlike ultrasound, doesn’t rely on the woman’s recollection of her last menstrual period.  The researchers also used a separate set of RNAs to identify women who were at risk of preterm delivery. This test predicted preterm and full-term births with an accuracy exceeding 80 percent, the study found. “The preterm birth result is important because of the tremendous potential impact on human health - something like 15 million babies each year are affected, and currently there are no good ways to predict who is at risk,” Quake said.  The researchers believe that similar blood tests can also be developed to identify and monitor fetuses with congenital defects that can be treated even before birth.

Three days later we woke to the news that another beloved figure, Anthony Bourdain, had taken his life. These two tragedies have inspired hundreds to tweet some version of the same message: Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. But deep in the comment threads, some have also been debating a more uncomfortable question: What do you do when a friend is depressed for such a long time that you‚ve started to feel that that nothing you can do will make a difference, and your empathy reserves are tapped out? There are no easy answers. But here are some tips from experts:Don‚t underestimate the power of showing upYou may not feel that your presence is wanted. But just being by the side of someone who is depressed, and reminding her that she is special to you, is important to ensuring that she does not feel alone, said Dr. Norman Rosenthal, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine. If she acknowledges she‚s depressed, that‚s a good sign, said Dr. Rosenthal. He recalled the story of a patient who stopped feeling suicidal after telling people he was close to how he was feeling.  ‚When you shine the light on the shame, it gets better,‚ Dr. Rosenthal said.[Follow @NYTHealth on Twitter. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Don‚t try to cheer him up or offer adviceYour brother has an enviable job and two lovely children. He‚s still ridiculously handsome even though he hasn‚t gone to the gym for six months. It‚s tempting to want to remind him of all these good things.Not only is that unlikely to boost his mood, it could backfire by reinforcing his sense that you just don‚t get it, said Megan Devine, a psychotherapist and the author of ‚It‚s O.K. That You‚re Not O.K.‚‚Your job as a support person is not to cheer people up. It‚s to acknowledge that it sucks right now, and their pain exists,‚ she said. Instead of upbeat rebuttals about why it‚s not so bad, she recommended trying something like, ‚It sounds like life is really overwhelming for you right now.‚  If you want to say something positive, focus on highlighting what he means to you, Dr. Rosenthal advised. And though offering suggestions for how to improve his life will be tempting, simply listening is better. It‚s O.K. to ask if she is having suicidal thoughts Lots of people struggle with depression without ever considering suicide. But depression is often a factor. Although you may worry that asking, ‚Are you thinking about killing yourself?‚ will insult someone you‚re trying to help ‚ or worse, encourage her to go in that direction ‚ experts say the opposite is true. ‚It‚s important to know you can‚t trigger suicidal thinking just by asking about it,‚ said Allen Doederlein, the executive vice president of external affairs at the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance.If the answer is yes, it‚s crucial that you calmly ask when and how; it‚s much easier to help prevent a friend from hurting herself if you know the specifics. Take any mention of death seriously Even when a person with depression casually mentions death or suicide, it‚s important to ask follow-up questions. If the answers don‚t leave you feeling confident that a depressed person is safe, experts advised involving a professional as soon as possible. If this person is seeing a psychiatrist or therapist, get him or her on the phone. If that‚s not an option, have the person you‚re worried about call a suicide prevention line, such as a 1-800-273-TALK, or take her to the hospital emergency room; say aloud that this is what one does when a loved one‚s life is in danger. In some cases, calling 911 may be the best option. If you do, ask for a crisis intervention team, Mr. Doederlein urged. But remember that interactions with law enforcement can vary wildly, depending on race and socio-economic background. In cases where you‚re concerned that calling police could put a person in danger, try to come up with an alternate plan in advance.Make getting to that first appointment as easy as possible You alone cannot fix this problem, no matter how patient and loving you are. A severely depressed friend needs professional assistance from a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker or another medical professional. Yeah, you know. You‚ve told your boyfriend this, but it‚s been months ‚ or maybe even years ‚ and he still has not set anything up. ‚You can‚t control someone else‚s recovery,‚ said Kimberly Williams, president and chief executive of the Mental Health Association of New York City. But you can try to make getting to that first appointment as easy as possible. That might mean sitting next to your friend as he calls to make the appointment, finding counseling that he can afford, or even going with him that first time, if you‚re comfortable with it.What if you‚re not sure whether you should start with a therapist or a psychiatrist, or whether you‚ve found the perfect person? Ask around for recommendations, and know that one practitioner may ultimately lead to another.  But don‚t overthink it. The key initially is just getting a professional involved so you are not the only person managing this situation. (That said, if that first appointment seems really unhelpful, trust your instincts and find someone else.)Take care of yourself and set boundariesWhen the thoughtful and kind people we‚ve loved for years are depressed, they may also become uncharacteristically mean and self-centered. It‚s exhausting, painful and hard to know how to respond when they pick fights or send nasty texts.‚You don‚t have to attend every argument you are invited to,‚ Ms. Devine said. Still, just because someone is depressed is not a reason to let their abusive behavior slide. Set clear boundaries with straightforward language such as, ‚It sounds like you‚re in a lot of pain right now. But you can‚t call me names.‚Similarly you may find that your friend‚s demands on your time are starting to sabotage other relationships or your job. You‚re not going to be able to help if you‚re not in a good place yourself. It‚s O.K. not to be available 24-7, but try to be explicit about when you can and cannot help. One way to do this, Ms. Devine advised, is to say: ‚I know you‚ve been really struggling a lot, and I really want to be here for you. There are times that I physically can‚t do that.‚Then come up with a contingency plan and kindly push her to stick with it.

",What to Do When a Loved One Is Severely Depressed ,"June 5, 2018 /  11:45 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-abortion-depression/abortion-not-tied-to-increased-risk-of-depression-idUSKCN1J134J,"(Reuters Health) - Women who have an abortion may be no more likely to develop depression than women who don’t, a Danish study suggests.  Researchers examined data on 396,397 women born in Denmark between 1980 and 1994, including 30,834 who had an abortion and 85,592 who had a baby. Overall, 15 percent of the women had at least one antidepressant prescription. Women who had an abortion were 54 percent more likely to take antidepressants in the year after the procedure than women who didn’t have abortions but were tracked for the same one-year period, the study found. But their increased use of antidepressants was already evident in the year before the abortions, when these women were 46 percent more likely to take antidepressants than their counterparts who didn’t have abortions.  The difference in rates of depression in the years before and after the abortion was not large enough to be statistically significant, meaning it could have been due to chance, the authors said. “Our study shows that there was an association between abortion and antidepressant use - but because the risk of antidepressant use was the same in the year before and after the abortion and goes down as more time from the abortion passes, it cannot be that abortion is causing depression or antidepressant use,” said lead study author Julia Steinberg, a public health researcher at the University of Maryland, College Park. “Other factors - such as having a history of mental illness, being from social disadvantage, or adverse experiences like experiencing intimate partner violence - are associated with having an abortion and having depression,” Steinberg said by email. “These other factors are risk factors for depression, while having an abortion is not a risk factor for depression.” Despite previous research failing to show that abortion directly causes mental health problems, opponents of abortion have used the potential for psychological disorders as a reason to justify laws restricting access to these procedures, researchers note in JAMA Psychiatry. Many earlier studies relied on women to truthfully report any history of abortion or mental illness, which can be unreliable due to faulty memory or participants’ desire to make themselves seem socially acceptable when they answer questions, researchers note.  The current study sidesteps this flaw by examining data from the Danish National Patient Registry, which has information on treatment at all hospitals in Denmark, and from a similar Danish registry covering all prescriptions.  Women were followed starting in 2000 or on their 18th birthday, whichever came last, through 2012. Women were excluded from the analysis if they had been diagnosed with a mental health disorder in childhood or adolescence or if they had an abortion after the first trimester. One year after an abortion, women were 24 percent more likely to have received an antidepressant prescription than women who didn’t have these procedures, the study found. But five years afterward, the increased risk of depression was just 12 percent.  When researchers looked at depression among women who had babies, the picture looked different than it did for women who had abortions. In the year before mothers gave birth, they were 54 percent less likely to have depression than other women in the study that year who didn’t give birth. In the year after giving birth, however, these mothers were only 7 percent less likely to be depressed than other women. And, five years after giving birth, these mothers who had babies were twice as likely to have depression as women who didn’t give birth. The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how abortion or childbirth might directly impact the chance of developing depression.  Because the study relied on prescription data to identify women with depression, it also may have underestimated the proportion of women with the mood disorder after childbirth because women who breastfed babies may have chosen not to take medication, said Dr. Nada Stotland, author of an accompanying editorial and a psychiatry professor at Rush University in Chicago.  Still, the study adds to decades of evidence suggesting that abortion does not cause mental illness, Stotland said by email.  “Poverty, lack of education, and psychiatric illness are factors that make women more likely to terminate pregnancies—and probably, in my opinion, more vulnerable to problem pregnancies in the first place,” Stotland said. “The study demonstrates that, while women who had abortions were more likely to take antidepressants than women who gave birth to babies, their use of antidepressants preceded the abortions and did not increase after the abortions.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2LVL7Mi JAMA Psychiatry, online May 30, 2018.

The same carbon molecules, broadly classified as organic matter, also exist within meteorites that fall from space. They can also be produced in chemical reactions that do not involve biology.But the discovery, published on Thursday by the journal Science, is a piece of the Mars puzzle that scientists have long been seeking. In 1976, NASA‚s two Viking landers conducted the first experiments searching for organic matter on Mars and appeared to come up empty.‚Now things are starting to make more sense,‚ said Jennifer L. Eigenbrode, a biogeochemist at NASA‚s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and lead author of the Science paper. ‚We still don‚t know the source of them, but they‚re there. They‚re not missing any more.‚ [Sync your calendar with the solar system. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The data comes from NASA‚s Curiosity rover, which has been exploring a former lake bed within the 96-mile Gale Crater where it landed in 2012. The discovery shows that organic molecules can be preserved near the Martian surface, surviving the bombardment of radiation from the sun.  ‚It‚s very exciting for Mars geology and for the search for life,‚ said Sanjeev Gupta, a professor of earth sciences at Imperial College London in England, who was a co-author on the paper. A second paper in Science adds wrinkles in the Martian puzzle of methane ‚ a simple molecule of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms ‚ that could also play an important part in figuring out whether life ever arose there and might even persist underground today.The organic matter was found in pieces of solidified mud that Curiosity drilled into in 2015. The rocks formed about 3.5 billion years ago when Mars was drying out, although Gale Crater was still filled with water for stretches of thousands to millions of years. The rock fragments were heated to more than 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and the rover‚s instruments looked at the molecules that wafted away at the high temperatures. Then the scientists sifted through the results to figure out what might be genuine Martian organics.The analysis was complicated in part because a cup of solvent within the rover‚s mobile laboratory had leaked, contributing misleading signals. In addition, some of the readings could have come from contamination that had tagged along from Earth; others could have been produced in combustion as the sample was heated, which may have been the case in an earlier detection of organics by Curiosity. ‚If we weren‚t sure, we removed it,‚ Dr. Eigenbrode said.In the end, a few smidgens of organics remained, including benzene and propane molecules.‚The detective work they did is worthy of Sherlock Holmes,‚ said Katherine Freeman, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved with the research. ‚What they show is that organics were present early on in Mars.‚Intriguingly, the organics Dr. Eigenbrode and her colleagues detected looked like they were pieces that came from more complex material. The molecules could have come from something like kerogen, a component of fossil fuel that is found in coal and oil shale.But the scientists cannot say what the larger molecules were or how they formed.‚We‚ve considered three possible sources for the organics: geology, meteorites and biology,‚ she said. When they did experiments in their laboratory on Earth to bake samples containing those three types of organic carbon, the readings were all consistent with what was detected on Mars.That means they do not have compelling evidence for a biological origin of the carbon, but the possibility is not ruled out, either. ‚It's on the table with all the other ones,‚ Dr. Eigenbrode said. In the second Science paper, scientists led by Christopher R. Webster of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., find that levels of methane in the thin Martian atmosphere are usually very low, less than 0.5 parts per billion by volume. But with data now extending over five years, the scientists reported that methane levels go up and down by a factor of three, and the variations appear to follow Martian seasons.‚It's very, very fascinating and puzzling,‚ Dr. Webster said.Planetary scientists originally expected little methane in the Martian atmosphere, because that molecule is readily destroyed by sunlight and chemical reactions. But in 2003, observations from Earth indicated plumes of methane over parts of Mars. Those readings vanished two years later.Because methane does not last in the atmosphere, any significant amounts there today must have been released recently. Methane can be created by geological interactions between rock, water and heat, or it could be a product of microbes that release methane as a waste product. Curiosity added to the mystery when it looked for methane and initially didn‚t find any at all. A refined technique was able to measure lower levels, below 1 part per billion. Then in 2013 it recorded a burst of methane that lasted at least two months.The rover has measured a few more methane spikes, but the new wrinkle is the undulations in the low background levels ‚ higher in summer than winter. With the seasonal patterns, scientists can now begin to test ideas on the source of the methane, Dr. Webster said.Michael J. Mumma, a scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center who led earlier Earth-based measurements and who is not involved with the Curiosity research, said the work was carefully done and confirms the low background levels, but that he was not yet convinced of the seasonality of the variations.  He said his team has conducted another round of ground-based measurements earlier this year but they have not yet analyzed the data.Additional information will come from the European Space Agency‚s Trace Gas Orbiter, which began its scientific data gathering a couple of months ago. Eventually, it will produce a global map of methane, but no results have been released yet.Future missions could also provide additional clues to help scientists solve both the methane and organics puzzles. NASA‚s InSight spacecraft, currently en route, will measure marsquakes. It is possible that the impacts of meteors, which InSight might be able to record, rupture the surface and allow underground pockets of methane to rise into the atmosphere. Two rovers launching in 2020, one from NASA and one from the European Space Agency, will also gather better rock samples to study organics. The European one will be able to drill a couple of yards into Martian rock, much deeper than the couple of inches that Curiosity was able to delve into. The next NASA rover plans to collect rocks that will be brought back to Earth on a later mission where scientists will be able to examine them with a much wider array of instruments.‚Imagine what we can do on Earth in Earth laboratories in 10 years‚ time,‚ Dr. Gupta said.  ",Life on Mars? Rover‚Äôs Latest Discovery Puts It ‚ÄòOn the Table‚Äô,"June 7, 2018 /  6:10 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-mars/nasa-rover-data-shows-mars-had-the-ingredients-needed-for-life-idUSKCN1J32HY,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A NASA rover has detected a bonanza of organic compounds on the surface of Mars and seasonal fluctuations of atmospheric methane in findings released on Thursday that mark some of the strongest evidence ever that Earth’s neighbor may have harbored life. But National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists emphasized there could be nonbiological explanations for both discoveries made by the Curiosity rover at a site called Gale crater, leaving the issue of Martian life a tantalizing but unanswered question. Three different types of organic molecules were discovered when the rover dug just 2 inches (5 cm) into roughly 3.5 billion-year-old mudstone, a fine-grained sedimentary rock, at Gale crater, apparently the site of a large lake when ancient Mars was warmer and wetter than the desolate planet it is today.   Curiosity also measured an unexpectedly large seasonal cycle in the low levels of atmospheric methane. About 95 percent of the methane in Earth’s atmosphere is produced from biological activity, though the scientists said it is too soon to know if the Martian methane also is related to life. Organic molecules are the building blocks of life, though they can also be produced by chemical reactions unrelated to life. The scientists said it is premature to know whether or not the compounds were created in biological processes. Whether anywhere other than Earth has harbored life, perhaps even in microbial form, is one of the paramount questions in science.  “There’s three possible sources for the organic material,” said astrobiologist Jennifer Eigenbrode of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. “The first one would be life, which we don’t know about. The second would be meteorites. And the last one is geological processes, meaning the rock-forming processes themselves.” The rover, which has allowed scientists to explore whether Mars ever boasted conditions conducive to life, in 2014 made the first definitive detection of organic molecules, also in Gale crater rock formed from ancient lake sediment - but it was a much more limited set of compounds.

Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/Handout via REUTERS “What the organic detections in the rock do is to add to the story of habitability. It tells us that this ancient environment on Mars could have supported life,” Eigenbrode said. “Everything that was needed to support life was there. But it doesn’t tell us that life was there.” Christopher Webster, an atmospheric science research fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said it is possible existing microbes are contributing to the Martian atmospheric methane. “With this new data, we again cannot rule out microbial activity as a potential source,” Webster said. The amount of methane peaked at the end of summer in the northern hemisphere at about 2.7 times the level of the lowest seasonal amount. The scientists were surprised to find organic compounds, especially in the amounts detected, considering the harsh conditions, including bombardment of solar radiation on the Martian surface. After drilling, Curiosity heats the rock samples, releasing the compounds. Referring to the findings regarding organic compounds and methane, Webster said, “They hint at an earlier time on Mars when water was present and the existence of primitive life forms was possible.” Slideshow (7 Images)The scientists hope to find better preserved organic compounds with Curiosity or other rovers that would allow them to check for chemical signatures of life.

Harry Potter can cast a celebratory spell. And ‚Angels‚ can rejoice.Our annual survey of Tony Awards voters suggests that, after a season that some found frustratingly unoriginal, a handful of shows have emerged as clear industry favorites, including ‚The Band‚s Visit,‚ ‚Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,‚ and ‚Angels in America.‚We talked to 110 of the 842 voters over the last few days; they were granted anonymity because the balloting process is secret. Their ballots are due at noon on Friday, and the ceremony, a presentation of the American Theater Wing and the Broadway League, begins at 8 p.m. Sunday, broadcast on CBS from Radio City Music Hall.Without further ado, here‚s what we learned:In the big race, the little show is winning.Best new musical is the one Tony category that generally has a significant box office impact. And the winner this year is likely to be the show that needs it the most: ‚The Band‚s Visit.‚ Nearly 80 percent of the voters we surveyed said they were voting for the musical, which is adapted from a fictional 2007 Israeli film about an Egyptian police orchestra that unexpectedly spends a night in a Jewish desert town. A gentle show about longing for connection, the musical has been selling solidly, but not amazingly, at the box office.The musical wowed critics, and its admirers were rapturous. ‚I would vote for it 10 times if I could,‚ one voter said. Another opined, ‚It‚s interesting, it‚s new, it‚s fresh ‚ it‚s the thing we all want when we go to the theater, to be surprised.‚[Sign up for Theater Update, a weekly email of news and features.]The also-rans in this category are all far-better-known titles ‚ ‚Mean Girls,‚ ‚SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical‚ and ‚Frozen.‚ Both ‚Frozen‚ and ‚Mean Girls‚ have been selling strongly at the box office; ‚SpongeBob‚ has been underperforming. Several voters said they went with ‚The Band‚s Visit,‚ at least in part, as a protest against the commercialism of the other entrants. ‚The Band‚s Visit,‚ one voter said, is ‚an adult musical exploring grown up themes, unlike the other nominees.‚ Others said they weren‚t sure what the fuss was about: ‚What a terrible year for musicals. This was the least worst choice.‚ Another said, ‚Had it been any other season with compelling competition my vote would have possibly gone elsewhere.‚A few voters even said they were boycotting the category. As one put it, ‚I didn‚t vote for best musical because there isn‚t one.‚Get ready for ‚Harry Potter and the Multiple Tonys.‚ ‚Harry Potter and the Cursed Child‚ is the costliest play Broadway has ever seen, it got excellent reviews, and it‚s selling strongly. And in a season short on conversation-starting dramas, about two-thirds of our voters said they went for ‚Cursed Child,‚ the only nominee still running, as the best play.The two-part production, written by Jack Thorne, was universally praised for its stagecraft. And it appeared to benefit from low expectations on the part of some theater industry veterans who had doubted whether a play based on a series of wildly popular children‚s books about a boy wizard would make quality drama.‚I expected to hate it,‚ one voter said. ‚And then I loved it.‚ Another voter called it ‚truly an all-around spectacle of storytelling and presentation.‚Of course, ‚Cursed Child,‚ which originated in London, is not for everyone; some, especially those unfamiliar with the books or films, said they found it difficult to follow. Muggles were largely divided between two other British plays, ‚The Children‚ and ‚Farinelli and the King,‚ with the two American contenders, ‚Junk‚ and ‚Latin History for Morons,‚ lagging behind.A dead heat among musical revivals, but ‚Angels‚ leads plays. There were only three musical revivals this season, but all three ‚ ‚Carousel,‚ ‚My Fair Lady‚ and ‚Once on This Island‚ ‚ got good reviews and have enthusiastic partisans, leaving that race too close to call.In our survey, 39 percent of voters supported ‚My Fair Lady,‚ 35 percent favored ‚Once on This Island,‚ and 25 percent chose ‚Carousel.‚ Given that our survey is not a scientific poll, those percentages are too close to make a prediction with any confidence; anything could happen.Among plays, the outcome seems clearer. Voters were enthusiastic about both ‚Angels in America,‚ by Tony Kushner, which was a Broadway sensation in 1993 and 1994, and ‚Three Tall Women,‚ by Edward Albee, which had never previously run on Broadway.But about 60 percent of the voters we surveyed chose ‚Angels‚ as the best, and about 27 percent went for ‚Three Tall Women.‚ The other contenders are ‚The Iceman Cometh,‚ ‚Lobby Hero‚ and ‚Travesties.‚Many voters went out of their way to tell us how much they loved ‚Angels‚ as a feat of playwriting. ‚Greatest American play ever written,‚ one voter said. ‚He‚s a present day Shakespeare,‚ another said of Mr. Kushner. And a third voter explained: ‚‚Angels in America‚ is just one of those plays for which you have to bow down and give full respect. It‚s the winner.‚ Lead actresses look like sure bets. Glenda Jackson could win by acclamation.Nine out of 10 voters said they were going to vote for her performance as the imperious matriarch in ‚Three Tall Women,‚ and they weren‚t shy about why:‚Transcendent.‚ ‚Just absolutely, absolutely thrilling.‚ ‚An old pro at the height of her abilities.‚ ‚I feel lucky to have seen this.‚Ms. Jackson, who is 82 and took a long detour from acting to serve in the British Parliament, has been nominated four times previously for a Tony Award; she has never won.Voters also loved Katrina Lenk as the sultry cafe owner at the heart of ‚The Band‚s Visit.‚ This is Ms. Lenk‚s first Tony nomination, but many voters were also impressed with her performance last season in ‚Indecent,‚ and 65 percent of those we surveyed voted to give her a Tony.‚There was so much emotion inside her, and she moved me,‚ one voter said. ‚A nuanced elegant performance,‚ another noted. And a third: ‚Exotic and sexy and funny and enigmatic. Who wouldn‚t fall in love with her?‚Andrew Garfield is a favorite, but for musical actors it‚s still a race. Andrew Garfield‚s raw performance as Prior Walter, the prophetic AIDS-afflicted sufferer at the heart of ‚Angels in America,‚ moved many voters, and he seems sure to win a Tony for best leading actor in a play as a result. Two-thirds of those we surveyed said they were voting for Mr. Garfield.‚Simply astonishing,‚ one voter said of Mr. Garfield. And another: ‚He made the character sympathetic, obnoxious, charming, annoying and most of all ‚ sexy ‚ all at the same time.‚Last year the surest shot for a Tony for best leading actor in a musical was Ben Platt in ‚Dear Evan Hansen,‚ but this time around, that category is far too close to call.Tony Shalhoub of ‚The Band‚s Visit‚ led slightly over Joshua Henry of ‚Carousel,‚ with Ethan Slater, the title star of ‚SpongeBob SquarePants‚ swimming just behind.Any of them could win.

Giuliani to speak for him. But no less than Mr. Trump‚s wife and his chief diplomat spent Thursday explaining that Mr. Giuliani does not always know what he is talking about.Melania Trump, the first lady, let it be known that Mr. Giuliani has no idea how she feels about Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress who goes by the name Stormy Daniels and says she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump, while Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, made clear that Mr. Giuliani has nothing to do with North Korea policy. Their pushback came in response to the latest in a series of seemingly off-script moments by Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor who has joined the legal team representing Mr. Trump in the special counsel‚s investigations into his campaign and associates.Mr. Giuliani has been something of a loose cannon, making public comments that surprised other advisers, were later contradicted or touched on matters beyond his ostensible mandate. At a conference in Israel this week, Mr. Giuliani said Mrs. Trump accepted her husband‚s denial that he had any sexual liaisons with Ms. Clifford. ‚She believes her husband and she knows it‚s untrue,‚ Mr. Giuliani said.That drew a sharp retort from the first lady‚s office. ‚I don‚t believe Mrs. Trump has ever discussed her thoughts on anything with Mr. Giuliani,‚ the first lady‚s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said in an email to The New York Times. The unusually pointed response from a first lady who rarely engages in conflicts the way her husband does may have spoken to a sensitivity that goes beyond Mr. Giuliani. Even as she rejected Mr. Giuliani as a spokesman for her feelings, Mrs. Trump did nothing to affirm that she did accept her husband‚s explanation of what happened with Ms. Clifford. Also left uncertain was the degree to which Mr. Giuliani is freelancing when he says such things or reflecting what the president wants him to say. In a telephone interview on Thursday, Mr. Giuliani did not say his client had told him about Mrs. Trump‚s feelings. But the president has frequently instructed his lawyer on what to say about topics related to Ms. Clifford and the special counsel investigation.Mr. Trump may not have had qualms about Mr. Giuliani‚s public denunciation of Ms. Clifford. At the same conference, Mr. Giuliani said she was not credible because of her career in the sex industry. ‚I‚m sorry, I don‚t respect a porn star the way I respect a career woman or a woman of substance or a woman who has great respect for herself as a woman and as a person and isn‚t going to sell her body for sexual exploitation,‚ he said.Ms. Clifford‚s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said Mr. Giuliani was the one with the credibility problem. ‚My client @StormyDaniels should be celebrated for her courage, strength and intelligence,‚ he wrote on Twitter. ‚She is one of the most credible people I have ever met regardless of gender. Period. I would be put her character up against Mr. Giuliani‚s any day of the week.‚ As for Mr. Pompeo, he looked pained when asked at a White House press briefing on Thursday about Mr. Giuliani‚s foray into North Korea diplomacy. While in Israel, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump agreed to resume plans for a summit meeting only after Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, pleaded with him to do it.‚Kim Jong-un got back on his hands and knees and begged for it, which is exactly the position you want to put him in,‚ Mr. Giuliani said.Mr. Pompeo, who has met twice with Mr. Kim and led Mr. Trump‚s efforts to set up a meeting to discuss North Korea‚s nuclear program, made clear that he did not find Mr. Giuliani‚s intervention helpful.‚I know Rudy,‚ he told reporters at the White House after a meeting between Mr. Trump and Japan‚s prime minister. ‚Rudy doesn‚t speak for the administration when it comes to this negotiation and this set of issues.‚The often prickly North Koreans did not immediately respond to Mr. Giuliani‚s portrayal of what happened, and Mr. Pompeo sought to play it down as a joke. ‚I took him as being in a small room and not being serious about the comments,‚ he said. ‚I think it was a bit in jest. We‚re moving forward. We‚re focused on the important things.‚Mr. Giuliani also ventured into Middle East peace as Jared Kushner, the president‚s son-in-law and senior adviser, has developed a plan to resolve the decades-old dispute between the Israelis and Palestinians.Mr. Giuliani suggested that the Palestinians should, like Mr. Kim, get down on their knees and beg. ‚That‚s what needs to happen with the Palestinian Authority,‚ he said. ‚They have to be seeking peace. You‚ve got to change the dynamic and put the pressure on them.‚The former mayor told Israeli reporters that he had seen Mr. Kushner‚s secret peace plan and that it made ‚all the sense in the world.‚ But Mr. Giuliani called The Wall Street Journal afterward to say he only knew what had been in news reports. ‚I have not seen any secret plan or been told about one,‚ he said. ‚I based my comments on the publicly available discussion of the plan.‚",Giuliani Speaks for Trump.

In fact, there are 17 staff members in Mueller’s special prosecutor’s office. Thirteen are registered Democrats; four are either unaffiliated or their affiliation is unknown, according to the Washington Post. Mueller himself is a registered Republican, as is Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed him. Mueller is investigating whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election and whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. Criminal charges have been brought against Trump campaign aides, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. He is also looking into whether Trump tried to obstruct the investigation. Both Russia and Trump deny collusion, and the president has denied obstruction. Mueller’s office has a policy of not commenting on its work. “They can’t emotionally come to grips with the fact that this whole thing of Russian collusion didn’t happen, (and) they are trying to invent theories of obstruction of justice,” said Giuliani, a former New York mayor, referring to Mueller’s team. On Sunday, Giuliani told the U.S. television network ABC it is an “open question” whether Trump would sit for an interview with Mueller, but the president’s lawyers were leaning against having him testify.

On her website she describes herself as a ‚DOCTOR TO THE STARS!‚ ‚ someone with ‚a surgeon‚s hands‚ and ‚a woman‚s touch.‚She wanted to be known as the ‚dancing doctor,‚ said Latoyah Rideau, the patient who appears in the video and who is now planning to sue Dr. Davis-Boutte for pain and suffering.Instead of dancing, Ms. Rideau said, Dr. Davis-Boutte should have been paying more attention to her work. ‚I just wanted my butt a little rounder and smaller,‚ she said.What she received instead were lopsided buttocks and continual itching on her left side, she said.‚I can‚t live like this. It affects my relationship, it affects everything,‚ Ms. Rideau said. ‚I‚m very self-conscious.‚Ms. Rideau will join at least nine other patients who have sued Dr. Davis-Boutte. The patients claim her negligence left them disfigured and, in one case, brain damaged.The Georgia Composite Medical Board said on Thursday that it ‚received reliable information‚ this week that a patient had been taken by ambulance to a hospital on May 31, one day after a liposuction, breast augmentation and a Brazilian butt lift operation. The patient had a collapsed lung and suffered from anemia because of acute blood loss, the board said.The patient remained in the hospital as of Wednesday. Dr. Davis-Boutte‚s treatment ‚failed to conform to the minimal standards of acceptable and prevailing medical practice,‚ the board said. The order described a ‚pattern of conduct,‚ citing unsatisfactory treatment for six other patients.‚Since the suspension, she‚s not able to comment at this time,‚ a publicist for Dr. Davis-Boutte said.In an interview on HLN posted on Thursday, Dr. Davis-Boutte said, ‚I‚ve done nothing wrong.‚ She later added, ‚I‚m a surgeon, I‚m supposed to be able to multitask.‚Dr. Davis-Boutte‚s website advertises a variety of cosmetic procedures including liposuction, breast augmentation, tummy tucks and Brazilian butt lifts. It says she has ‚MASTERFUL SURGICAL EXPERTISE, having sought additional extensive training by some of the most famous surgeons in the world.‚But Susan Witt, a medical malpractice lawyer who is representing Ms. Rideau, said Dr. Davis-Boutte was ‚practicing well outside the scope of what she should be doing based on her education and training.‚At least 100 people have come forward to complain about Dr. Davis-Boutte, said Ms. Witt, who has been involved with litigation against her for two and a half years. Ms. Witt has filed four complaints so far, and went public about the lawsuits in May because Dr. Davis-Boutte continued to treat patients.Ms. Witt said Thursday that she was pleased with the medical board‚s suspension of the doctor‚s license, but ‚frustrated and disheartened that it‚s taken them this long to arrive at this decision.‚ If the license had been revoked earlier, some recent patients would not have been harmed, she said.‚I think they ultimately acted because of public pressure,‚ Ms. Witt said. ‚It should not have had to come to this.‚ In 2016, Ms. Witt represented the guardian of a woman who sustained brain damage after a liposuction procedure. That year, in the midst of the litigation, Dr. Davis-Boutte started posting numerous YouTube videos online, Ms. Witt said, that showed her dancing and gesturing in front of patients who appear to be sedated.The videos have since been removed from social media, Ms. Witt said, but they were used in court by Chloe E. Dallaire, a lawyer who is also representing former patients of Dr. Davis-Boutte, during a hearing for a case that was settled last fall.Ms. Dallaire said Dr. Davis-Boutte was not complying with requests for information about infection control practices.‚I used the videos to demonstrate to the court that we had severe concerns about those practices and evidence to support our contention,‚ said Ms. Dallaire, whose law firm was involved in a few other cases involving Dr. Davis-Boutte. Another is expected to be filed on Monday.This year Ms. Witt provided the videos ‚ which number more than 20 ‚ to news outlets including The New York Times. In one video, Dr. Davis-Boutte dances to ‚Cut It,‚ a song by O.T. Genasis that went multiplatinum in 2017.As the song starts playing, Dr. Davis-Boutte prods at the midsection of Ms. Rideau, who is lying facedown on the operating table. She fingers rolls of skin and jiggles them to the beat.As the hook picks up, she begins slicing at the air with her scalpel, just inches from the patient‚s back. Then the video shows Dr. Davis-Boutte making incisions, her scalpel moving rhythmically. She pauses to wave the scalpel at the camera, the music continuing to play.Ms. Rideau, 37, a hairdresser in New Orleans, said that in addition to suing Dr. Davis-Boutte for pain and suffering she would also be seeking money to fix her disfigurement.‚It was gross,‚ Ms. Rideau said of the video. ‚And to know that she never stopped dancing while she was doing my procedure goes to show why my body is disfigured and messed up.‚Four days after her surgery in February 2017, Dr. Davis-Boutte sent Ms. Rideau a text message about the video. Ms. Rideau shared it with The Times.‚Hey, check out today‚s IG post...‚Cut It‚ is your song, girlfriend!...You did awesome!!!‚ the text said, referring to an Instagram page that is now private. ‚So if you want to tell people that that is you, go for it!!!‚ Ms. Rideau, who was still recovering from the surgery, said she was still heavily medicated and didn‚t fully understand the message. She remembered clicking on the video, but didn‚t watch it all.Then, in May, she saw it on the news.‚I said, ‚That‚s me,‚‚ she recalled.Dr. Davis-Boutte‚s profile on the Composite State Board of Medical Examiners website lists four medical malpractice settlements between October 2017 and February 2018. Three were for $900,000 or more, with the highest settlement being $1 million.A lawsuit brought by the guardian of Icilma Cornelius, who was injured in February 2016 during liposuction surgery, was settled for an undisclosed amount, Ms. Witt said.Ms. Witt said her three other cases against Dr. Davis-Boutte are pending. The lawsuits allege that Dr. Davis-Boutte not only botched procedures but also used unqualified staff, misled her patients and worked in an unsafe environment.Ms. Cornelius paid more than $11,200 to remove hanging skin and fat from the lower abdomen and to perform liposuction on various parts of her body, according to the complaint. But during the surgery she went into cardiac arrest and now suffers from a brain injury and other conditions that have left her reliant on a feeding tube, the complaint said. She will require extensive medical care and ‚assistance with all aspects of daily living‚ for the rest of her life, the documents said.In a statement a day before Dr. Davis-Boutte was suspended, her publicist insisted that the dermatologist was a ‚known expert in this field‚ with ‚decades of experience and a countless number of clients.‚‚She is authorized to perform cosmetic surgery,‚ the statement said. ‚She is dedicated and committed to giving her clients the utmost professional, masterful surgical expertise and experience.‚",Doctor Who Danced During Surgery Is Suspended by Georgia Medical Board,"May 22, 2018 /  6:45 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-terminal-care-surgery/palliative-care-training-helps-doctors-steer-cancer-patients-away-from-major-surgery-idUSKCN1IN2NN,"(Reuters Health) - Doctors who don’t have palliative care training are more likely to recommend aggressive surgery for patients with life-limiting diseases, a study suggests. Researchers surveyed 102 surgeons, oncologists, intensive care specialists, and palliative care doctors near Sacramento, California, asking how they would respond to four different surgical conditions in patients with very advanced cancers.  Overall, regardless of doctors’ age, years of experience or medical specialty, those with less than 40 hours of palliative care training were more likely to recommend major operations as opposed to less aggressive procedures, the study team reported in the journal Surgery. In one scenario, someone with advanced colon cancer had a bowel obstruction. In another, someone with advanced breast cancer had been injured in a car accident. The other two scenarios involved a patient with late-stage lung cancer and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and a patient with advanced prostate cancer and a groin hernia.  In general, there wasn’t much consensus on the treatment decisions, regardless of the doctors’ specialties. Surgeons in particular reported fewer hours of palliative care training during residency, fellowship and continuing medical education; one in five surgeons reported no experience with palliative care training at all, the authors found.  “We’ve seen a significant proportion of patients who go to the emergency room or intensive care unit with terminal malignancy die in the ICU,” said study coauthor Dr. Richard Bold of the University of California, Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center in Sacramento.  “As cancer becomes a leading cause of death among aging Americans, we’re all going to have to deal with these questions, from family to primary care doctors to specialists,” Bold told Reuters Health by phone. Palliative care is not the same as hospice care, although the two have elements in common. Importantly, patients who receive palliative care may continue to receive treatment for their disease. “It is important to remember that anyone facing a life-threatening diagnosis should be eligible for palliative care,” said Dr. Mustafa Raoof of the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, California, who wasn’t involved with this study.  Raoof and colleagues have implemented a Surgical Palliative Care Immersion Training program for junior surgeons, based on the American College of Surgeon’s “Surgical Palliative Care: A Resident’s Guide” framework.  “Many in the field already know that this is a critical deficiency,” he told Reuters Health by email. “Our group and others have shown that it does not take much time to implement either.”  An overall cultural shift is also changing how surgeons make decisions about procedures near the end of life, said Dr. Pasithorn Suwanabol of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.  Suwanabol, who wasn’t involved with this study, published a study last month which found that surgeons know about the benefits of palliative care but find it difficult to know when and how to start palliative care conversations and integrate the services. Part of this is not being able to predict what will happen next to the patient, Suwanabol said. “We need to better predict patient trajectories and outcomes so we can better meet their palliative care needs,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Studies should also measure patient needs from their perspective, not only from the perspective of the surgeons.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2khHlQU Surgery, online April 27, 2018.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Palliative care training helps doctors steer cancer patients away from major surgery,R

Voters in Ireland, a once deeply Catholic nation, backed the change by two-to-one, a far higher margin than any opinion poll in the run up to the vote had predicted. Penny Mordaunt, Britain’s women and equalities minister, said that the victory to legalise abortion should now bring change north of the Irish border. “A historic and great day for Ireland and a hopeful one for Northern Ireland,” Mordaunt said. “That hope must be met.” Northern Ireland has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe with even rape and fatal foetal abnormality not considered legal grounds for a termination. And unlike other parts of the United Kingdom, abortions are banned apart from when the life or mental health of the mother is in danger. Since the collapse of a power sharing administration in Northern Ireland at the beginning of last year, British officials have been taking major decisions in the region. But any moves to change the law could destabilise the British government by antagonising the socially conservative Democratic Unionist Party, which May depends on for her parliamentary majority.

He will not have an office in the interim.Mr. Lasseter, 61, served as chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios, which he helped found, and the separate Walt Disney Animation studio. Disney did not name replacements. Jennifer Lee, a director of ‚Frozen,‚ is expected to be promoted at Walt Disney Animation, and Pete Docter, the director of films like ‚Up‚ and ‚Inside Out,‚ is expected to take on greater responsibilities at Pixar, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because plans had not been finalized.A self-described Peter Pan, Mr. Lasseter has long been known for his jolly public persona and tendency to greet anyone in his proximity ‚ subordinates, stars, fans, reporters ‚ with lengthy bear hugs. In 2011, The Wall Street Journal published a photo slide show of his frequent squeezes, saying he had handed out at least 48 of them in one day at the office. Mr. Lasseter said in November that he would take a ‚six-month sabbatical‚ after unspecified ‚missteps‚ that made some staff members feel ‚disrespected or uncomfortable.‚ He made the announcement in a lengthy email to employees apologizing ‚to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape or form.‚The email came as the #MeToo and Time‚s Up movements gained momentum in Hollywood. It also coincided with an article in The Hollywood Reporter that cited ‚grabbing, kissing and making comments about physical attributes‚ as recurring behavior by Mr. Lasseter in meetings and at work events, particularly when consuming alcohol.Since then, he has kept a low profile in Hollywood, skipping the Academy Awards in March, when Pixar‚s ‚Coco‚ won the Oscar for best feature animation, and spending time in Italy and New Zealand. He did not attend the premiere on Tuesday for Pixar‚s latest film, ‚Incredibles 2,‚ which will be released in theaters on June 15 and is expected to be a box office juggernaut.In a statement announcing Mr. Lasseter‚s departure, Robert A. Iger, Disney‚s chief executive, did not address the reasons. Mr. Iger instead emphasized Mr. Lasseter‚s achievements, crediting him with ‚reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks and telling original, high-quality stories that will last forever.‚ Mr. Iger also said that Mr. Lasseter was leaving behind ‚a team of great storytellers and innovators.‚Mr. Lasseter said in a statement that he had concluded that the time had come ‚to begin focusing on new creative challenges.‚ He added, ‚I remain dedicated to the art of animation and inspired by the creative talent at Pixar and Disney.‚The accusations against Mr. Lasseter did not rise to the level of those against powerful Hollywood figures like Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of severe sexual misconduct going back decades, and Bill Cosby, who was found guilty in April of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman.But Mr. Lasseter‚s sabbatical revealed other areas of concern. Disney conducted what it called a ‚day of listening‚ in February as part of an effort to improve the culture at Pixar and Walt Disney Animation. Multiple staff members told managers that Mr. Lasseter had become increasingly domineering, according to two people who work at the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process was private.The decision to part ways with Mr. Lasseter was a complicated one.People in Mr. Lasseter‚s camp contended that he had been unfairly swept up in the Time‚s Up movement and that his behavior did not warrant his ouster. Allowing him to return to his old job, or at least a similar one, would prevent Wall Street from worrying about the health of Disney‚s animation engines. It would also prevent Mr. Lasseter, an executive widely heralded as a creative genius, from going to work for a competitor.But retaining Mr. Lasseter would have divided employees, leaving some women particularly unhappy. The tension was palpable at the ‚Incredibles 2‚ premiere. The insiders in attendance raucously cheered as credits for the principal creative team appeared on the screen. But the theater became noticeably quieter when Mr. Lasseter‚s name appeared as an executive producer.In recent weeks, a #LoseLasseter campaign had appeared on Twitter.Pixar has been criticized over the years as a boy‚s club. Women have produced Pixar hits, but only one of Pixar‚s 20 feature films, ‚Brave,‚ has a credited female director. That woman, Brenda Chapman, was fired halfway through production after she clashed with Mr. Lasseter. Ms. Chapman subsequently joined DreamWorks Animation, telling The New York Times in 2013 that ‚you can butt heads here and not be punished for it, unlike at another place I could name.‚Mr. Lasseter‚s supporters have pointed out that he hired Ms. Lee as a director of ‚Frozen,‚ which was praised for its departure from Disney‚s romantic ‚princess‚ formula. She is now working on ‚Frozen 2,‚ which is set for release in November 2019. Pixar has also started to focus more on female lead characters, including Joy in ‚Inside Out‚ and Dory the forgetful fish in ‚Finding Dory.‚ But Rashida Jones, the actress and writer, said in November that she left a Pixar assignment early because of the way the studio treated female and minority employees.‚There is so much talent at Pixar, and we remain enormous fans of their films,‚ Ms. Jones and her writing partner, Will McCormack, said in a statement at the time. ‚However, it is also a culture where women and people of color do not have an equal creative voice.‚Ed Catmull, 73, a Pixar co-founder, remains president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios. Disney also has a deep bench of animation superstars, including the directors Brad Bird (‚The Incredibles‚), Andrew Stanton (‚Finding Nemo‚), Byron Howard (‚Zootopia‚) and Lee Unkrich (‚Toy Story 3‚).Disney could gain animation leaders from its pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets, which include Blue Sky Studios. Blue Sky, founded by a group of animation innovators including Chris Wedge, is known for the ‚Ice Age‚ franchise.Because of his enormous creative input across the entertainment conglomerate, Mr. Lasseter has been heralded in the news media as a latter-day Walt Disney. And the company held Mr. Lasseter up as a celebrity.At a D23 Expo fan event in 2015, for instance, there was a museum-style exhibit of 20 of his most prized Hawaiian shirts. (He has more than 1,000.)In recent years, however, Mr. Lasseter has stumbled at times. Disney was forced to scrap ‚Gigantic,‚ an animated take on ‚Jack and the Beanstalk,‚ and took a $98 million write-down. ‚The Good Dinosaur‚ in 2015 was a box office failure, and ‚Cars 2‚ in 2011 was Pixar‚s first critical dud. Mr. Lasseter, who also operates a winery in Sonoma County with his wife, Nancy, nonetheless pushed forward ‚Cars 3,‚ which received improved reviews but stalled at the box office. Sales of related toys were also disappointing.Mr. Lasseter‚s association with Disney started while he was a teenager. He worked at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., where he skippered a Jungle Cruise boat. He grew up in nearby Whittier, where his mother was an art teacher and father worked as a parts manager at a car dealership.After graduating from the California Institute of the Arts, Mr. Lasseter started his animation career at Disney in 1978 but was fired a few years later. Disney was still clinging to hand-drawn animation, and Mr. Lasseter insisted that the future of animation involved computer graphics. He went on to help found Pixar, which is based near San Francisco.Pixar became famous for its noncorporate atmosphere ‚ encouraging artists to combine work with play as a way to spark creativity. The Pixar campus has a swimming pool and a basketball court.Walt Disney Animation, struggling after years of cost-cutting and box office misfires like ‚Treasure Planet,‚ paid $7.4 billion for Pixar in 2006, or $9.4 billion in today‚s money. Mr. Iger put Mr. Lasseter and Mr. Catmull in charge of turning around the Burbank-based Walt Disney Animation studio.Mr. Lasseter, shuttling endlessly by jet between Northern and Southern California, was also given a role at Imagineering, Disney‚s theme-park research and design division, where he advised on popular, Pixar-based attractions like Cars Land and Toy Story Mania. He also had major input at Disney Consumer Products, the world‚s No. 1 licenser.After a few stops and starts, Mr. Lasseter and Mr. Catmull resuscitated Disney‚s well-known cartoon studio, delivering one of the biggest hits in the company‚s history: ‚Frozen,‚ which has spawned theme park attractions, a Broadway musical, touring ice-skating shows and toys galore.",Pixar Co-Founder to Leave Disney After ‚ÄòMissteps‚Äô,"June 8, 2018 /  10:49 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-walt-disney-animation-lasseter/disney-animation-chief-pixar-co-founder-lasseter-to-quit-after-missteps-idUSKCN1J4322,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co animation head and co-founder of Pixar John Lasseter, regarded as a modern day Walt Disney because of his creativity and commercial success, will leave at the end of the year, the company said on Friday. FILE PHOTO: Executive Producer John Lasseter attends Disney-Pixar's U.S. premiere of ""Coco"" in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 8, 2017.  REUTERS/David McNew/File PhotoLasseter was the creative force behind movie hits like “Toy Story,” “Frozen,” and “Finding Nemo,” that won Academy Awards and reaped billions of dollars at the box office. Friday’s decision, announced in a Disney statement, followed a six month leave of absence by Lasseter after what he called “missteps,” including unwanted hugs that made employees uncomfortable. “Following his sabbatical, John Lasseter will assume a consulting role at The Walt Disney Company until December 31, 2018, at which time he will be leaving the company,” Disney said. Disney did not announce a replacement but Chief Executive Bob Iger noted in the statement that Lasseter had assembled “a team of great storytellers and innovators with the vision and talent to set the standard in animation for generations to come.” Lasseter, 61, said in the statement that “the last six months have provided an opportunity to reflect on my life, career and personal priorities.” “While I remain dedicated to the art of animation and inspired by the creative talent at Pixar and Disney, I have decided the end of this year is the right time to begin focusing on new creative challenges,” he added. Lasseter joined the company in 2006 when Disney bought Pixar Animation Studios. A pioneer in computer animation, Lasseter was the driving creative force behind Disney’s success in animated films over the past decade. He is chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios.  Disney animation and Pixar films have sold roughly $14 billion worth of tickets worldwide since Lasseter joined Disney, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the Box Office Mojo website. Lasseter took his leave after a report in the Hollywood Reporter last November that said some women at Disney had been made uncomfortable by physical contact from him. He apologized in November in a memo to employees who felt “disrespected or uncomfortable,” but said his intent was “benign.”  Multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against entertainers, businessmen and politicians in the past year have led to many being fired or to resignations. The scandal inspired a widespread #MeToo social media movement by victims of sexual harassment or abuse.  Lasseter was absent earlier this week from the world premiere in Hollywood for Pixar’s next release, “The Incredibles 2” on June 15. Online ticket seller Fandango said this week that the movie is on pace to become its biggest animated pre-seller ever.

It also coincided with an article in The Hollywood Reporter that cited ‚grabbing, kissing and making comments about physical attributes‚ as recurring behavior by Mr. Lasseter in meetings and at work events, particularly when consuming alcohol.Since then, he has kept a low profile in Hollywood, skipping the Academy Awards in March, when Pixar‚s ‚Coco‚ won the Oscar for best feature animation, and spending time in Italy and New Zealand. He did not attend the premiere on Tuesday for Pixar‚s latest film, ‚Incredibles 2,‚ which will be released in theaters on June 15 and is expected to be a box office juggernaut.In a statement announcing Mr. Lasseter‚s departure, Robert A. Iger, Disney‚s chief executive, did not address the reasons. Mr. Iger instead emphasized Mr. Lasseter‚s achievements, crediting him with ‚reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks and telling original, high-quality stories that will last forever.‚ Mr. Iger also said that Mr. Lasseter was leaving behind ‚a team of great storytellers and innovators.‚Mr. Lasseter said in a statement that he had concluded that the time had come ‚to begin focusing on new creative challenges.‚ He added, ‚I remain dedicated to the art of animation and inspired by the creative talent at Pixar and Disney.‚The accusations against Mr. Lasseter did not rise to the level of those against powerful Hollywood figures like Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of severe sexual misconduct going back decades, and Bill Cosby, who was found guilty in April of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman.But Mr. Lasseter‚s sabbatical revealed other areas of concern. Disney conducted what it called a ‚day of listening‚ in February as part of an effort to improve the culture at Pixar and Walt Disney Animation. Multiple staff members told managers that Mr. Lasseter had become increasingly domineering, according to two people who work at the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process was private.The decision to part ways with Mr. Lasseter was a complicated one.People in Mr. Lasseter‚s camp contended that he had been unfairly swept up in the Time‚s Up movement and that his behavior did not warrant his ouster. Allowing him to return to his old job, or at least a similar one, would prevent Wall Street from worrying about the health of Disney‚s animation engines. It would also prevent Mr. Lasseter, an executive widely heralded as a creative genius, from going to work for a competitor.But retaining Mr. Lasseter would have divided employees, leaving some women particularly unhappy. The tension was palpable at the ‚Incredibles 2‚ premiere. The insiders in attendance raucously cheered as credits for the principal creative team appeared on the screen. But the theater became noticeably quieter when Mr. Lasseter‚s name appeared as an executive producer.In recent weeks, a #LoseLasseter campaign had appeared on Twitter.Pixar has been criticized over the years as a boy‚s club. Women have produced Pixar hits, but only one of Pixar‚s 20 feature films, ‚Brave,‚ has a credited female director. That woman, Brenda Chapman, was fired halfway through production after she clashed with Mr. Lasseter. Ms. Chapman subsequently joined DreamWorks Animation, telling The New York Times in 2013 that ‚you can butt heads here and not be punished for it, unlike at another place I could name.‚Mr. Lasseter‚s supporters have pointed out that he hired Ms. Lee as a director of ‚Frozen,‚ which was praised for its departure from Disney‚s romantic ‚princess‚ formula. She is now working on ‚Frozen 2,‚ which is set for release in November 2019. Pixar has also started to focus more on female lead characters, including Joy in ‚Inside Out‚ and Dory the forgetful fish in ‚Finding Dory.‚ But Rashida Jones, the actress and writer, said in November that she left a Pixar assignment early because of the way the studio treated female and minority employees.‚There is so much talent at Pixar, and we remain enormous fans of their films,‚ Ms. Jones and her writing partner, Will McCormack, said in a statement at the time. ‚However, it is also a culture where women and people of color do not have an equal creative voice.‚Ed Catmull, 73, a Pixar co-founder, remains president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios. Disney also has a deep bench of animation superstars, including the directors Brad Bird (‚The Incredibles‚), Andrew Stanton (‚Finding Nemo‚), Byron Howard (‚Zootopia‚) and Lee Unkrich (‚Toy Story 3‚).Disney could gain animation leaders from its pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets, which include Blue Sky Studios. Blue Sky, founded by a group of animation innovators including Chris Wedge, is known for the ‚Ice Age‚ franchise.Because of his enormous creative input across the entertainment conglomerate, Mr. Lasseter has been heralded in the news media as a latter-day Walt Disney. And the company held Mr. Lasseter up as a celebrity.At a D23 Expo fan event in 2015, for instance, there was a museum-style exhibit of 20 of his most prized Hawaiian shirts. (He has more than 1,000.)In recent years, however, Mr. Lasseter has stumbled at times. Disney was forced to scrap ‚Gigantic,‚ an animated take on ‚Jack and the Beanstalk,‚ and took a $98 million write-down. ‚The Good Dinosaur‚ in 2015 was a box office failure, and ‚Cars 2‚ in 2011 was Pixar‚s first critical dud. Mr. Lasseter, who also operates a winery in Sonoma County with his wife, Nancy, nonetheless pushed forward ‚Cars 3,‚ which received improved reviews but stalled at the box office. Sales of related toys were also disappointing.Mr. Lasseter‚s association with Disney started while he was a teenager. He worked at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., where he skippered a Jungle Cruise boat. He grew up in nearby Whittier, where his mother was an art teacher and father worked as a parts manager at a car dealership.After graduating from the California Institute of the Arts, Mr. Lasseter started his animation career at Disney in 1978 but was fired a few years later. Disney was still clinging to hand-drawn animation, and Mr. Lasseter insisted that the future of animation involved computer graphics. He went on to help found Pixar, which is based near San Francisco.Pixar became famous for its noncorporate atmosphere ‚ encouraging artists to combine work with play as a way to spark creativity. The Pixar campus has a swimming pool and a basketball court.Walt Disney Animation, struggling after years of cost-cutting and box office misfires like ‚Treasure Planet,‚ paid $7.4 billion for Pixar in 2006, or $9.4 billion in today‚s money. Mr. Iger put Mr. Lasseter and Mr. Catmull in charge of turning around the Burbank-based Walt Disney Animation studio.Mr. Lasseter, shuttling endlessly by jet between Northern and Southern California, was also given a role at Imagineering, Disney‚s theme-park research and design division, where he advised on popular, Pixar-based attractions like Cars Land and Toy Story Mania. He also had major input at Disney Consumer Products, the world‚s No. 1 licenser.After a few stops and starts, Mr. Lasseter and Mr. Catmull resuscitated Disney‚s well-known cartoon studio, delivering one of the biggest hits in the company‚s history: ‚Frozen,‚ which has spawned theme park attractions, a Broadway musical, touring ice-skating shows and toys galore.",Pixar Co-Founder to Leave Disney After ‚ÄòMissteps‚Äô,"June 8, 2018 /  10:48 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/walt-disney-animation-lasseter/disney-animation-executive-lasseter-to-leave-company-at-year-end-idUSL2N1TA22X,"June 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co animation head and co-founder of Pixar John Lasseter will be leaving Disney at the end of the year, the company said in a statement. Lasseter, who directed the 1995 hit “Toy Story,” went on a leave of absence in November, following what he called “missteps,” including unwanted hugs that made employees uncomfortable, according to a memo at the time seen by Reuters. The Oscar-winning animation executive will serve in a consulting role until his Dec. 31 departure, the company said. Multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against entertainers, businessmen and politicians in the past year have led to many being fired or to resignations.  The scandal inspired a widespread #MeToo social media movement by victims of sexual harassment or abuse.

Jun 8, 2018; Elmont, NY, USA; Justify trains on the main track in preparation for the 150th running of the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park. Mandatory Credit: Dennis Schneidler-USA TODAY SportsBaffert says Justify, unraced as a 2-year-old and unbeaten in five career trips to the post, has been “moving over the track really well” as he bids to become the 13th horse in history to win horse racing’s Triple Crown. “This is what a trainer hopes to see the day before his horse runs,” added Baffert, who is seeking his second Triple Crown winner after achieving the feat with American Pharoah in 2015. That was the first time a horse had won all three signature races since Affirmed in 1978. The odds-on favorite after winning the first two legs, Justify will face nine other 3-year-olds in the 1 1/2-mile race at expansive Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y., the largest oval of any thoroughbred racetrack in North America. If Justify does so, he’ll be just the second horse in history to win the Triple Crown without tasting defeat — the first was the legendary Seattle Slew in 1977. The Belmont Stakes is the longest of the Triple Crown races, one lap around the main track with a stretch ending in front of a huge and boisterous grandstand full of fans anxious to witness history. It will be the only time Justify, or any of those lined up to try to stop his run to immortality, ever races that far. Justify, the burly chestnut son of Scat Daddy out of the Ghostzapper mare Stage Magic, already has proven his mettle, as he became the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby without a start as a 2-year-old since Apollo in 1882. He followed that historical win with another in the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore three weeks ago but is up against another barrier Saturday in the suburbs of the Big Apple: No horse has ever captured the Triple Crown without having started at age 2. “It’s been an incredible journey,” Justify’s trainer, Bob Baffert, said Wednesday. “It’s been quick. He’s handled everything thrown at him without losing his composure. A lot of horses get nervous, hot. Justify thrives on this. “Not only is he a great athlete, but he has a great mind. In the Derby, the Preakness, he was in the paddock like he’d handled it all before. He’s a very fearless type of horse.” If Justify wins, he will set a record for the most opponents beaten in a Belmont Stakes with a Triple Crown at stake, a remarkable achievement considering he didn’t compete in a race until Feb. 18. If he loses, he will join an even longer list, becoming the 21st horse since 1944 — and the 13th since 1979 — to win the Derby and Preakness but fall short when competing in the Belmont. Justify looked right at home on the track during his first workout at Belmont on Thursday, moving around briskly and galloping with authority. He still looks as though he’s carrying good weight, and there are no signs that the demanding road to win three Grade 1 races on three tracks at three distances in just five weeks have worn him down. Both the Derby and the Preakness — as well as the Santa Anita Derby prior to the Triple Crown races — were run on off tracks, meaning the surfaces were affected by rain. Those conditions are obviously to Justify’s liking. The forecast for Saturday calls for a 40-percent chance of afternoon showers, with a high of 79 degrees. Justify has drawn the rail and the No. 1 post position and will most likely use his speed to get the lead under jockey Mike Smith and try to outlast any other horse who tries to go with him or run him down in the stretch. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Justify has 'smooth' final workout ahead of Belmont,Y

Justify was installed as a 4-5 morning line favorite during a draw that was held on Tuesday at the home of Major League Baseball’s New York Mets. The chestnut son of Scat Daddy needs a victory in the 1-1/2 mile (2.4 km) race to become the 13th Triple Crown winner and first since American Pharoah in 2015 to win the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes. Ridden by Mike Smith and trained by Hall of Famer Bob Baffert, Justify has only run five races in his career and will be tested by some fresher horses in the Belmont Stakes, which has often ended the dreams of many Triple Crown hopefuls. “I never do like to draw the rail, but my horses seem to live in it,” said Baffert who trained the most recent Triple Crown winner. “I just feel that, I think most importantly, the horse is doing well. ... We have it. We can’t change it. So we’ll just deal with it.” Triple Crown hopeful Justify gets bathed after arriving at his stable at Belmont Park racetrack in Elmont, New York, U.S., June 7, 2018.

If Justify does so, he’ll be just the second horse in history to win the Triple Crown without tasting defeat — the first was the legendary Seattle Slew in 1977. The Belmont Stakes is the longest of the Triple Crown races, one lap around the main track with a stretch ending in front of a huge and boisterous grandstand full of fans anxious to witness history. It will be the only time Justify, or any of those lined up to try to stop his run to immortality, ever races that far. Justify, the burly chestnut son of Scat Daddy out of the Ghostzapper mare Stage Magic, already has proven his mettle, as he became the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby without a start at 2 since Apollo in 1882. He followed that historical win with another in the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore three weeks ago but is up against another barrier Saturday in the suburbs of the Big Apple: No horse has ever captured the Triple Crown without having started at age 2. “It’s been an incredible journey,” Justify’s trainer, Bob Baffert, said Wednesday. “It’s been quick. He’s handled everything thrown at him without losing his composure. A lot of horses get nervous, hot. Justify thrives on this. “Not only is he a great athlete, but he has a great mind. In the Derby, the Preakness, he was in the paddock like he’d handled it all before. He’s a very fearless type of horse.” If Justify wins, he will set a record for the most opponents beaten in a Belmont Stakes with a Triple Crown at stake, a remarkable achievement considering he didn’t compete in a race until Feb. 18. If he loses, he will join an even longer list, becoming the 21st horse since 1944 — and the 13th since 1979 — to win the Derby and Preakness and fall short when competing in the Belmont. Justify is owned by China Horse Club, Head of Plains Partners LLC, Starlight Racing and WinStar Farm. His lifetime earnings are now more than $2.9 million. A New York Times report last week said Justify’s breeding rights have been sold to Coolmore Stud for $60 million, a figure that was negotiated before the colt won the Preakness. The same report claims that figure will increase by $25 million if Justify wins the Triple Crown. Justify looked right at home on the track during his first workout at Belmont on Thursday, moving around briskly and galloping with authority. He still looks as though he’s carrying good weight, and there are no signs that the demanding road to win three Grade 1 races on three tracks at three distances in just five weeks have worn him down. Both the Derby and the Preakness — as well as the Santa Anita Derby prior to the Triple Crown races - were run on off tracks, meaning the surfaces were affected by rain. Those conditions are obviously to Justify’s liking. The forecast for Saturday calls for a 40 percent chance of afternoon showers, with a high of 79 degrees. Justify has drawn the rail and the No. 1 post position and will most likely use his speed to get the lead under jockey Mike Smith and try to outlast any other horse who tries to go with him or run him down in the stretch. As for those that will try to beat Justify in the Belmont, six have run against him in one of the other Triple Crown races. Those most likely to take a run at stopping Justify are Hofburg, who was a troubled seventh in the Derby; Noble Indy and Vino Rosso, trained by three-time Belmont winner Todd Pletcher; and Bravazo and Tenfold, both beaten less than a length by Justify in the Preakness. Hofburg will be the second choice to Justify. His trainer, Hall of Famer Bill Mott, won the Belmont in 2010 with Drosselmeyer. “Our horse has plenty of stamina,” Mott said. “That’s his forte. He keeps coming. He fits the profile of a horse who’ll like the Belmont. I have a lot of respect for Justify. It’s a major challenge to beat him. But you can’t let him go around by himself.” The other three runners are making their first appearance in a Triple Crown race. Blended Citizen comes off a victory over this track in the Peter Pan Stakes on May 12. Restoring Hope, also trained by Baffert, is still eligible for a first-level allowance and is running at the urging of owner Gary West. Gronkowski, sure to take money being named for and now co-owned by tight end Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots, is making his first start since being imported to the United States and turned over to trainer Chad Brown. He will race on Lasix for the first time. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Justify roaring and ready to claim Triple Crown at Belmont Stakes,Y

I‚ll be rooting for, but betting against.Hoppert: He towers over his peers, both literally and figuratively, and this is his race to lose. But a sixth race since mid-February, especially with the past two coming on sloppy tracks, is a tall task. But I hope he proves me wrong.2. Free Drop BillyTrainer: Dale Romans Jockey: Robby Albarado Odds: 30-1Drape: He lost all chance breaking from the No. 2 post at the Kentucky Derby ‚ so draw a line through that race. That leaves a colt with a grinding style and the stamina to last a mile and a half at a huge price.Hoppert: His 16th-place Derby finish doesn‚t scream bet me, especially because his somewhat-clean trip doesn‚t really give him any excuses.3. BravazoTrainer: D. Wayne Lukas Jockey: Luis Saez Odds: 8-1Drape: He earned his role as a potential spoiler by giving Justify all he could handle in the closing strides of the Preakness. Hoppert: This gritty colt with an old-school trainer has put together back-to-back surprising finishes in the Derby (sixth) and the Preakness (second). Don‚t leave him out of your exotics.4. HofburgTrainer: Bill Mott Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Odds: 9-2Drape: This colt deservedly is going to take a lot of money. He is lightly raced, bred for the distance and in expert hands.Hoppert: A Hall of Fame trainer, a star New York jockey, and a sire, Tapit, who has produced three of the past four Belmont winners. If there‚s an upset, this is likely the one who is pulling it off.5. Restoring HopeTrainer: Bob Baffert Jockey: Florent Geroux Odds: 30-1Drape: It‚s odd that Baffert would put in a rabbit for a colt like Justify, who is his own rabbit. He has led virtually every step of the way in all his victories.Hoppert: Justify‚s stablemate is in this race to help set the pace. He won‚t be around at the finish.6. GronkowskiTrainer: Chad Brown Jockey: Jose Ortiz Odds: 12-1Drape: This one is strictly for New England Patriots fans who will bet him down, then spend hours on talk radio saying Gronk gets no respect.Hoppert: The overseas invader has never raced on dirt and hasn‚t faced competition this talented. Plus, he‚ll take money because of his name. Pass. 7. TenfoldTrainer: Steve Asmussen Jockey: Ricardo Santana Jr. Odds: 12-1Drape: He finished big in Baltimore and offers a pedigree that is long on stamina. Still, he‚s lightly raced and you have to wonder how much the Preakness took out of him.Hoppert: The sire of this third-place Preakness finisher is Curlin, who had stamina and speed, and his dam is Temptress, by Tapit. It‚s certainly tempting to think he will hit the board.8. Vino RossoTrainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: John Velazquez Odds: 8-1Drape: Like Free Drop Billy, this colt was compromised at the start of the Derby. Still, he fought on and has been working lights-out at Belmont ever since. The pick.Hoppert: The ninth-place Derby finisher is also by Curlin (see above), and his dam is a half sister to a Belmont runner-up. The combination of Pletcher (three Belmont wins) and Velazquez (two) puts him above Tenfold in my book.9. Noble IndyTrainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Javier Castellano Odds: 30-1Drape: This colt should keep Justify and Restoring Hope company into the stretch. He has been fierce in the lane before. He is not the worst long shot on the board.Hoppert: The speedy 17th-place Derby finisher will also go to the lead, and under the right circumstances, he can maybe hang around for a piece at the end.10. Blended CitizenTrainer: Doug O‚Neill Jockey: Kyle Frey Odds: 15-1Drape: This guy has yet to live up to the buzz he has generated on the West Coast.

The favored three-year-old chestnut colt seized an early lead he never relinquished as he stormed around the 1.5 mile (12-furlong) course in two minutes 28.18 seconds for the wire-to-wire win at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. The 24-1 long-shot Gronkowski battled from the back of the pack to cross the line second, almost two lengths behind Justify, while the 5-1 Hofburg finished third amid overcast but dry conditions. The victory marks the second Triple Crown win for Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert, who also won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes with American Pharoah in 2015.  “This never gets old,” an emotional Baffert said after the race.      “American Pharoah, he’ll always be my first love. For this horse to do it for (jockey) Mike Smith, he deserved something like this. It feels pretty good.” Related CoverageFactbox: Triple Crown winner JustifyBaffert said Justify was simply the best horse at the track on Saturday. “He could have won every race on the undercard today, he’s just that kind of horse.”  The large and muscular Justify, owned by China Horse Club, Head of Plains Partners, Starlight Racing & WinStar Farm, made 52-year-old Smith the oldest jockey to ever win the Triple Crown.  “This horse ran a tremendous race. He’s so gifted he’s sent from heaven,” Smith said of Justify, who was the 4/5 favorite.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson“He’s just brilliant.”  Smith thanked Baffert for giving him the opportunity to ride Justify into the history books.  “He’s made a lot of my goals come true but today, he made my dream come true. I appreciate it.”  Justify was sired by Champagne Stakes and Florida Derby champion Scat Daddy and was born at Glenwood Farm in Versailles, Kentucky. From early on, Baffert said it was clear that Justify was special.  “I’ve wanted to see that horse’s name up there because we knew he was brilliant from day one.”  Slideshow (13 Images)With the win, Justify, who did not race as a two-year-old, improved to 6-0 in his young career, which started just 111 days ago.  Some had wondered whether the colt might show signs of fatigue following a busy schedule but that was not the case as he broke from his number one post position and was never seriously challenged by any of the other nine horses.  Saturday’s race, the 150th running of the Belmont Stakes, marked the fifth time Baffert came to Belmont with a shot at the Triple Crown.

Kilimnik, is a Russian Army-trained linguist prosecutors have accused of having ties to Russian intelligence.The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has not publicly sought to connect Mr. Kilimnik or Mr. Manafort to Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but Friday‚s indictment of Mr. Kilimnik could carry symbolic significance nonetheless.The charges are the first in Mr. Manafort‚s case against someone accused of having ties to Russian intelligence. And they come as Mr. Manafort‚s lawyers ‚ and Mr. Trump and his allies ‚ are arguing that Mr. Mueller has ventured beyond his remit of investigating Russian election interference. Mr. Kilimnik, 48, served as Mr. Manafort‚s right-hand man in Ukraine for more than a decade, working on behalf of the country‚s Russia-aligned former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, his party and its wealthy supporters.Starting in 2005 as a translator for Mr. Manafort, who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian, Mr. Kilimnik assumed progressively more responsibility in Mr. Manafort‚s business, eventually becoming the director of its Kiev operation. He also played an integral role in the creation and execution of a global lobbying and public relations campaign intended to defend Mr. Yanukovych against mounting international criticism for corruption, abuse of power and pivoting toward Russia.The special counsel claims that the work yielded tens of millions of dollars in payments to Mr. Manafort, on which he avoided paying taxes through a scheme using offshore accounts. He is free on a $10 million bond while awaiting trial on charges of violating financial, tax and federal lobbying disclosure laws. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.On Friday, the special counsel‚s team added to the list of charges Mr. Manafort faces, accusing him and Mr. Kilimnik of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice for trying to coach witnesses from whom the special counsel has sought information about the Ukraine lobbying work.Mr. Kilimnik may never stand trial on the charges. He is a Russian citizen who associates say has been living in his home country, which has given little indication it intends to extradite 13 Russians charged by Mr. Mueller in February with meddling in the election to help Mr. Trump. Mr. Mueller‚s team had referenced Mr. Kilimnik in previous court filings, though not by name, as well as his close connection to Mr. Manafort and the claim that he has ‚ties to a Russian intelligence service.‚Mr. Kilimnik was formally investigated in Ukraine in 2016 on suspicion of ties to Russian spy agencies, but no charges were filed, according to Ukrainian government documents.And in an interview last year with The New York Times, Mr. Kilimnik ‚vehemently‚ denied having ties to Russian intelligence, and characterized himself as ‚a random casualty because of my proximity to Paul,‚ referring to Mr. Manafort.Mr. Manafort remained in contact with Mr. Kilimnik throughout the presidential campaign, when Mr. Kilimnik traveled to the United States to meet with Mr. Manafort. The men also traded emails in which they appeared to discuss ways to use Mr. Manafort‚s position on the campaign for financial gain. Even after Mr. Manafort was first indicted by the special counsel in October 2017, he continued communicating with Mr. Kilimnik, working with him on an op-ed defending Mr. Manafort‚s work in Ukraine. The special counsel argued that the op-ed flouted a judge‚s admonition against trying to use the news media to influence the case.And court filings by the special counsel this week accused Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik of teaming up again starting in February to try to persuade two former associates to lie about the scope of a project on which they worked with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik. The project, which they referred to as the Hapsburg Group, ran from 2011 through 2014, and was funded with $2.4 million steered by Mr. Manafort from overseas bank accounts, according to prosecutors. It sought to recruit European politicians, such as Romano Prodi, the former prime minister of Italy and the former president of the European Commission, to vouch for Mr. Yanukovych in commentaries and meetings with government officials around the world.The two former associates, for instance, helped arrange for Mr. Prodi to visit Washington in March 2013 to meet with key members of Congress, and they helped him draft and place an Op-Ed in The Times in February 2014, according to prosecutors. Mr. Prodi has repeatedly said he was not aware of the involvement of Mr. Manafort or the existence of the Hapsburg Group.But prosecutors say that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik reached out to the two former associates to urge them to tell the special counsel‚s team that the Hapsburg Group‚s efforts consisted only of outreach in Europe and not in the United States.The question of the geographic target of the Hapsburg Group‚s activities is significant because any lobbying or public relations in the United States on behalf of foreign politicians, governments or companies would require disclosure with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.Mr. Manafort did not initially register under the act, and he is charged with lying to the Justice Department about his activities.Instead of engaging with Mr. Manafort or Mr. Kilimnik to coordinate their stories about the Hapsburg Group‚s work, the two former associates turned on their former colleagues. The associates ‚ who are not named by the special counsel, but whom three people familiar with the project identified as Alan Friedman and Eckart Sager ‚ informed the special counsel of the outreach, leading to allegations of witness tampering and Friday‚s obstruction charges.In a court filing on Friday night, Mr. Manafort‚s lawyers called the accusation of witness tampering ‚very specious,‚ and said it was a ‚not-too-subtle attempt to poison the potential jury pool against Mr. Manafort.‚ They argued that Mr. Manafort could not set out to tamper with witnesses because ‚he is not aware of who the special counsel may call as witnesses.‚ Mr. Manafort‚s allies said they had urged him to stop communicating with Mr. Kilimnik, who is known to associates as ‚K.K.,‚ because they fear that his communications are being monitored and that he is neither discreet, nor tactful.‚K.K. is one of the best interpreter and translators,‚ said Philip M. Griffin, a onetime employee of Mr. Manafort‚s in Ukraine who hired Mr. Kilimnik in 1995 to work in the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute, a nonprofit based in Washington. ‚On everything else, he is a dumbass.‚Mr. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment. He had told associates in recent months that he was working with Sam Patten, a former official in the International Republican Institute‚s Moscow office, on business in Kazakhstan.Mr. Patten did not respond to a question about the work. He said that he did not believe that Mr. Kilimnik was working with a lawyer in relation to the special counsel‚s investigation.Lobbying records filed last year by Mr. Manafort‚s firm show that it paid $531,000 to Mr. Kilimnik in 2013 and 2014 for ‚professional services‚ and overhead for running the Kiev operation, but that covers only a fraction of the time that he worked for Mr. Manafort.The men continued to work together for a successor party to Mr. Yanukovych‚s after he fled Ukraine in February 2014 amid protests of his government‚s corruption and pivot toward Moscow, eventually arriving in Russia and effectively ending his presidency.",Mueller Adds Obstruction Charge on Manafort and Indicts His Right-Hand Man,"June 11, 2018 /  5:09 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort/ex-trump-campaign-aide-manafort-to-be-arraigned-friday-on-new-charges-idUSKBN1J725M,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort will be arraigned on Friday following a third superseding indictment against him by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that lodged additional charges on accusations of witness tampering.

Manafort is currently under house arrest and required to wear GPS monitoring devices. The indictment last week included new counts against  Manafort and Manafort aide Konstantin Kilimnika, a political operative with alleged ties to Russian intelligence, for allegedly tampering with witnesses regarding their lobbying for Ukraine.  The additional charges could increase pressure on Manafort to cut a deal and cooperate with Mueller’s probe, legal experts said.  Friday’s indictment marked the first time that Kilimnik, who in previous court filings was referred to only as “Person A”, was named.

There are a range of recommended waiting periods to avoid discomfort and blood clotting while flying, but three experts, who have not treated the first lady, said that if Mrs. Trump‚s procedure had no complications, as the White House has repeatedly said, it would not be unheard-of for a physician to clear her for travel.In the past, the stylish, Slovenia-born first lady has been an asset to her husband on the world stage, and has at times softened the image of a president who tends to use blunt force in his diplomatic efforts.As he arrived in Canada for the Group of 7 summit meeting, Mr. Trump stood alone among other leaders and their spouses.

The coalition government, an alliance of conservatives and the far right, came to power soon after Europe’s migration crisis on promises to prevent another influx and restrict benefits for new immigrants and refugees. The moves follow a “law on Islam”, passed in 2015, which banned foreign funding of religious groups and created a duty for Muslim organizations to have “a positive fundamental view towards (Austria’s) state and society”. “Political Islam’s parallel societies and radicalizing tendencies have no place in our country,” said Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who, in a previous job as minister in charge of integration, steered the Islam bill into law. Standing next to him and two other cabinet members on Friday, far-right Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache told a news conference: “This is just the beginning.”  Austria, a country of 8.8 million people, has roughly 600,000 Muslim inhabitants, most of whom are Turkish or have families of Turkish origin.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said the new policy was part of an “Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory wave” in Austria.

ATIB spokesman Yasar Ersoy acknowledged that its imams were paid by Diyanet, the Turkish state religious authority, but it was trying to change that. “We are currently working on having imams be paid from funds within the country,” he told ORF radio.

Public Health England issued guidelines in March with the aim of reducing the calorie count of some popular foods by 20 percent by 2024.KFC itself has a seven-year initiative to achieve such a cut in the calorie count of its servings in Britain, and said its work on vegetarian ‚fried chicken‚ was part of that.In deciding to experiment with a vegetarian chicken substitute, KFC also seems to be responding to a growing demand for meat-replacement products such as tofu and soy-based burgers and sausages.American consumers spent $698.6 million on meat substitutes last year, up 25.6 percent from $556.3 million in 2012, according to statistics published by the research firm Euromonitor International.Demand for meat alternatives has also risen sharply in Britain, with consumers spending $374.1 million in 2017, up 56.2 percent from $239.5 million in 2012. McDonald‚s introduced a soy-based McVegan burger to its restaurants in Sweden and Finland in late December. It has drawn customers who had not visited a McDonald‚s in years, some of whom have praised it as ‚top notch‚ and ‚delicious.‚KFC‚s announcement provoked mixed reactions on Twitter, with one user declaring that ‚no vegetarian would set foot in a fried chicken chain.‚Another said it was ‚breathtaking how fast the plant meat 2.0 sector is moving.

The FSA statement followed a report in The Daily Telegraph, which said an investigation by the newspaper had detected traces of turkey in a Tesco vegan macaroni ready meal and traces of pork in Sainsbury’s “meat-free” meatballs. Sales of vegetarian and vegan products are rising in the UK, with one in 10 shoppers in Britain buying a meat-free ready meal in January 2018, according to data from research firm Kantar. The FSA said its priority was to ensure that consumers could be confident that the food they eat is what it says it is. That was not the case in 2013, when traces of horsemeat were found in some beef products sold in British supermarkets, including Tesco, in a scandal in the food industry which raised questions about the safety of the European supply chain. Sainsbury’s said in a statement that the meat-free meatballs were made at a meat-free factory and that it carried out regular checks and had found no issues. “We are concerned by these findings however and are carrying out a comprehensive investigation alongside our supplier,” the supermarket said in an emailed statement. Tesco said it had carried out initial DNA tests on the product in question, its BBQ Butternut Mac, and found no traces of animal DNA in the product. “We take the quality and integrity of our products extremely seriously and understand that our vegan and vegetarian products should be exactly that,” Tesco said in an emailed statement. “We would urge the Telegraph to share full details of their testing, including the lab used as we continue to investigate.” The Telegraph said it sent 10 different food items to a German-government accredited food testing lab which carried out tests for eight types of meat.

Some may believe it is not as golden as American Pharoah‚s, but it is a crown nonetheless.With a white blaze, a sweeping stride and an unblemished record, Justify came to the site where Pharoah ended a 37-year Triple Crown drought and, guided by the same trainer, took his own shot at history.Ridden by the 52-year-old ironman Mike Smith, Justify did not disappoint the crowd of about 90,000 as he quickly went to the lead and stayed there, despite a pack of contenders closing in behind him, to capture the 150th Belmont Stakes by a length and three-quarters and become the 13th Triple Crown winner.

Smith, who had earned the nickname Big Money Mike but had never won horse racing‚s most coveted prize, was moved to tears. How did he land this horse, who did not race as a 2-year-old, who rattled off six straight victories in about four months, who carried Smith beyond even his wildest dreams?But Smith had to gather himself because he wanted to bring Justify back to the fans, who stood and cheered and snapped pictures as he took a victory lap past the expansive Belmont Park grandstand. ‚This horse ran a tremendous race,‚ Smith said while flashing his customary wide grin. ‚He‚s so gifted; he was sent from heaven. I can‚t even begin to describe my emotions right now.‚Baffert, 65, seemed to keep his composure as he walked to the winner‚s circle, stopping to pat Ron Turcotte, the jockey for Secretariat, the ninth Triple Crown champion, on the back. But inside he was battling emotions as he became only the second trainer to secure two Triple Crowns, joining James Fitzsimmons, who was known as Sunny Jim and trained Gallant Fox and Omaha in the 1930s.‚American Pharoah, he‚ll always be my first love,‚ Baffert said, ‚but, man, for this horse to do it.‚ Since Wednesday, when Justify pulled up to Barn 1 at Belmont Park, minus the police escort that Pharoah had received, Baffert had appeared at ease. Gone were the nerves from 2015, when the curse of 37 years and the hopes of many rested on his shoulders.He called his crew Camp Justify, and the bucolic corner barn setting fit the bill. Owners, fans and even rival trainers stopped by to sneak a peek at the undefeated winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. Save for a news helicopter circling during training hours, the scene was as mellow as could be ‚ a mere three years between Triple Crown attempts will have such an effect. But it is said that history repeats, and it certainly seemed that way on Saturday. The great Secretariat ended a 25-year drought in 1973 in record fashion, then, four years later, Seattle Slew came along to put his perfect stamp on the feat.The next year, the classic rivalry of Affirmed and Alydar reached its peak when Affirmed inched ahead by a head to become the last Triple Crown winner until Pharoah arrived. The drought had lasted so long that many began to believe that the sweep would never again be accomplished. Now there have been two coronations over four Triple Crown seasons.Justify conquered the slop on May 5 to become the first horse since 1882 to win a Kentucky Derby without having raced as a 2-year-old and followed that feat with a damp and daring Preakness victory through a soupy fog on May 16 that sent him to New York with the crown on the line.‚Is he the next American Pharoah?‚ Baffert was asked throughout, and by the Belmont, he believed the answer was yes (although, for the record, he still thinks Pharoah could beat Justify). Still, the Belmont was Justify‚s sixth race since mid-February, and his previous two had come on sloppy tracks, surely taking a toll. He seemed to have recovered nicely from a hoof bruise after the Derby, but this mile-and-a-half race ‚ the Test of the Champion ‚ can expose even the most bulletproof horses.Justify‚s next chapter is yet to be written. Before the Preakness, WinStar Farm, China Horse Club and SF Racing, who owned his breeding rights, agreed to a reported $60 million deal with Coolmore, which stands American Pharoah at stud. There was to be a bonus of about $25 million if Justify won the crown. It is unclear whether he will race again, although his owners said they would consider it. Insurance alone would probably cost more than they could collect in purses for the rest of the year. But American Pharoah went on to win the Haskell and the Breeders‚ Cup Classic before retiring in the fall of 2015.This day, though, was all about Justify‚s achievement.His jockey had a new look for the race, wearing China Horse Club‚s red silks with yellow stars instead of the customary white silks with a green star that represent WinStar Farm. It was a matter of rotation among the owners. Baffert is highly superstitious, but he had no choice.When the gate opened, the switch did not matter one bit. Justify stepped into the gate and stood perfectly still, almost too still, Smith said. But he broke cleanly ‚ a must in Baffert‚s book ‚ and went to the lead, setting a furious pace. Smith slowed him and let him get into a rhythm. As he crossed the finish line, the racecaller Larry Collmus declared, ‚He‚s just perfect, and now he‚s just immortal.‚ ",Simply Perfect: Justify Wins the Triple Crown,"June 8, 2018 /  10:58 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-horseracing-belmont/justify-4-5-favorite-to-win-belmont-complete-triple-crown-idUSKCN1J432F,"(Reuters) - Unbeaten Justify was a 4/5 odds-on favorite on Friday to win the Belmont Stakes in New York, but far from a shoo-in to complete American horse racing’s triple crown on Saturday. Bob Baffert-trained Justify arrived in town on Wednesday ahead of his attempt to become the 13th horse to complete the triple crown, and the second in four years, after American Pharoah in 2015. Showers are possible for the 1 1/2 mile (2400m) race on the Belmont Park dirt in Elmont, New York. The Belmont Stakes, to be held for the 150th time, is the longest of the triple crown races.  Justify won the Kentucky Derby by 2 1/2 lengths and triumphed narrowly at the Preakness Stakes — both races run in sloppy conditions. “I think he’s got to run better than he did in the Preakness but we know going in he’s got the most talent,” NBC horse racing analyst Randy Moss said on Friday. Justify had never raced until February. Should he win, he will be only the second undefeated horse to complete the triple crown, joining Seattle Slew (1977). Ridden by two-times Belmont Stakes winning jockey Mike Smith, Justify has drawn the inside barrier. After wearing mainly white silks in the previous two triple crown races, Smith on Saturday will don the colors — red with yellow stars — of the China Horse Club, part owner of the three-year-old colt. Hofburg, a 9/2 shot ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr., is rated by punters as the most likely to beat Justify. He has not run since a seventh placing at the Kentucky Derby five weeks ago. Bravazo and Vino Rosso, both 8/1, are also considered legitimate threats. Luis Saez-ridden Bravazo nearly ran down a fading Justify in the final yards of the Preakness before finishing second, a half-length behind. Vino Rosso, ridden by John Velazquez, had a bad start at the Kentucky Derby but battled on to finish ninth after starting from a wide barrier.

The favored three-year-old chestnut colt seized an early lead he never relinquished as he stormed around the 1.5 mile (12-furlong) course in two minutes 28.18 seconds for the wire-to-wire win at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. The 24-1 long-shot Gronkowski battled from the back of the pack to cross the line second, almost two lengths behind Justify, while the 5-1 Hofburg finished third amid overcast but dry conditions. The victory marks the second Triple Crown win for Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert, who also won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes with American Pharoah in 2015.  “This never gets old,” an emotional Baffert said after the race.      “American Pharoah, he’ll always be my first love.

21667367,2745,['2018-06-09t14:25:37.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/09/us/suicide-rates-increasing-bourdain.html,"In a week when two celebrities, first the designer Kate Spade and then the chef and television host Anthony Bourdain, took their own lives, new federal data was released showing that suicide rates have been increasing for years in almost every state and across demographic lines.The escalating crisis has affected nearly every group and place, but the study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that some parts of the country have been hit especially hard. Here‚s a closer look at the study and the stories behind some of the data.Veteran deaths help account for Montana‚s high rate.Montana has the country‚s highest suicide rate, and suicides by military veterans are a significant contributor. A state study found that veterans account for more than 20 percent of Montana‚s suicides and that veterans have a suicide rate more than twice that of nonveterans.‚All the issues that we have in Montana are magnified in our veteran population,‚ said Karl Rosston, the state‚s suicide prevention coordinator. Mr. Rosston said rural isolation, easy access to guns and a lack of mental health services likely contributed to Montana‚s suicide rate, which has been among the country‚s highest for decades. States with the lowest suicide rates have stricter gun laws.Guns are used in nearly half of all suicides, and ready access to weapons is one of several risk factors. New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland and Connecticut have the country‚s lowest suicide rates. Those states are Democratic-leaning in their politics, clustered in the Northeast and have some of the country‚s strictest gun control laws, though researchers say many other factors could account for their low rates.The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which assigns letter grades to each state based on their strictness, grades each of those five states at a B+ level or higher. Texas and Nebraska, which have slightly higher suicide rates, have comparatively loose gun laws.White people and men are dying by the thousands.Suicide rates have increased across gender and geographic lines, but nearly 84 percent of people who kill themselves are white, and about 77 percent are men.‚There are mental health components, but also there‚s relationships, employment, a lack of connectedness that we might see in males that increases the risk for suicide,‚ said Misty Vaughan Allen, Nevada‚s state suicide prevention coordinator.Some point to gun seizure laws as a solution.Gun control advocates have called for more states to pass laws that allow police officers to seize guns from people they deem dangerous. In Indiana, where such a law has been on the books since 2005, a recent study linked the measure to a 7.5 percent drop from the expected rate of firearm suicides. There is also anecdotal evidence that the law is working. In 2016, the sheriff‚s department in LaPorte County, Ind., used the law to confiscate a handgun from a man threatening to kill himself.‚We think that it has thwarted at least several suicides,‚ said the county sheriff, John Boyd, a Republican. ‚We‚ve at least given them a time period to at least better think about their options and get them the help they need.‚Nevada is a hopeful outlier.Forty-nine states saw their suicide rates increase over the course of the C.D.C. study, in many cases by double-digit percentages.Nevada was the lone exception, with a slight reduction in its rate. State officials attributed the improvement to years of work with community groups and in isolated towns where people are at a higher risk of suicide. But the state‚s suicide rate remains among the country‚s 10 highest.‚We‚re still concerned about Nevada,‚ said Deborah Stone, the author of the C.D.C. study.",5 Takeaways on America‚Äôs Increasing Suicide Rate,"June 7, 2018 /  7:45 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-health-suicide/u-s-suicide-rates-see-sharp-increase-from-1999-to-2016-cdc-idUSKCN1J32PJ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Suicide rates rose in nearly every U.S. state from 1999 to 2016, with the rate spiking by more than 30 percent in half of the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on Thursday. Though mental health is often blamed for suicides, more than half of the people who took their own lives in 27 states in 2015 had not been diagnosed with a mental illness, the CDC said. While suicide rates rose across age groups, the CDC said people ages 45-64 had the biggest rate increase. That age group also had the highest rate. People ages 10-24 had the lowest rate. “It’s a national problem of wide scope that we need comprehensive approaches for,” said Anne Schuchat, a CDC deputy director.  Nearly 45,000 people committed suicide in 2016, making it one of three leading causes of death on the rise in the United States, along with Alzheimer’s disease and drug overdoses.  The death of designer Kate Spade by suicide in New York this week shocked the fashion world. Her husband said in a statement on Wednesday that she had suffered from depression and anxiety for many years. [nL2N1T8257] The CDC said suicides were rarely caused by any single issue.  In addition to mental health conditions and suicide attempts as risk factors, other contributing circumstances include social and economic problems, access to the means to commit suicide, and poor coping and problem-solving skills, the health agency said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report here The CDC found that suicides had increased in every state except Nevada, where they decreased by 1 percent. However, Nevada had the ninth-highest suicide rate in the country. North Dakota had the highest increase, at nearly 58 percent over the studied time period. Montana had the highest suicide rate, at 29.2 per 100,000 people per year, while the District of Columbia had the lowest, at 6.9 suicides per 100,000 people per year. The CDC recommended a broad approach to suicide prevention, including boosting economic support by states, supporting family and friends after a suicide, and identifying and supporting people at risk for suicide.

The 61st annual parade, held under gloomy skies, was part party, part protest march, part memorial, part pep rally, sometimes all in one person. Maria Torres stood behind the barricades on a block of Fifth Avenue lined with high-end boutiques, cheering and waving at the floats. She wore a ball cap that said ‚Puerto Rico se levanta‚ ‚ Puerto Rico rising ‚ and carried a sign: ‚I‚m from Luquillo, P.R. I am a Hurricane Maria survivor! Yo no me quito:‚ ‚ meaning I‚m not giving up or I‚m not leaving.Ms. Torres, 55, said she had traveled from her hometown on the island‚s northeast coast to deliver a message. ‚What they say is not true about the death toll,‚ she said. ‚I was there. I saw. And even my own sister-in-law died that night. She died because she was in intensive care when everything was shutting down.‚ Her message was simple: ‚Don‚t forget about us.‚The day began on a strident political note at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo‚s pre-parade breakfast at the Roosevelt Hotel, just off the parade route. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, delivered a steadily escalating condemnation of the Trump administration. ‚The lack of response, the disrespect, the lack of humanity,‚ Mr. Cuomo said, ‚is frankly disgusting and disturbing.‚ He declared that in addition to celebrating Puerto Ricans‚ resilience, the parade‚s attendees would also ‚stand and march in defiance.‚ The Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., typically rides on a float with a D.J. pounding out music. This year, he marched on foot, wearing a black T-shirt that said ‚4,645+‚ above the legend ‚Remember! Register! Resist!‚ After starting at the front with other politicians, Mr. Diaz, also a Democrat, turned around and walked against the parade traffic to join a group of protesters.A few blocks away, a group called Uprose carried signs demanding an audit of Puerto Rico‚s crippling public debt, which tops $70 billion.

The researchers estimated that most victims of the storm died between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, 2017, as a direct or indirect result of Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in 90 years. One-third perished because of delayed or interrupted medical care. While cautioning that the estimate of 4,645 victims may be too low, the researchers said the numbers “underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico.” The tally, reported online on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, is likely to be controversial because it is far higher than previous independent estimates.  The emergency response to the disaster became highly politicized and provoked criticism of President Donald Trump, who was faulted when much of the U.S. territory remained without power for months. Puerto Rico’s government released a statement on Tuesday welcoming the study and saying it would analyze it further. In the aftermath of the storm, Puerto Rico commissioned  George Washington University to conduct an independent study into the death toll, the results of which are due soon. “As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities. We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported,” Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said in the government statement.

REUTERS/Alvin Baez  The chief author of the new study, Caroline Buckee of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, did not respond to emails requesting comment.  Maria, a major hurricane with winds close to 150 miles (241 km) per hour, caused an estimated $90 billion in damage to an island already struggling economically and many residents have subsequently left. There is a wide margin for error in the study authored by Buckee. While the researchers estimated 4,645 deaths, the actual number could be as low as 793 and as high as 8,498, the study showed.  The tally of 4,645 dead is more than four times higher than a December estimate by the New York Times, which said the actual death toll was probably about 1,052. A Pennsylvania State University study put the number at 1,085. The Buckee team randomly conducted in-person surveys of 3,299 of the estimated 1.1 million Puerto Rican households earlier this year, making sure to include remote areas. Slideshow (2 Images)Respondents were not paid and were asked if a household member had died directly or indirectly as a result of the storm. Missing people were not counted as deaths. Respondents were also asked about deaths within a 5-minute walking distance of their homes. The Buckee team also said that in the aftermath of the storm households went, on average, 68 days without water, 84 days without electricity and 41 days without cell phone coverage. In the most remote areas, 83 percent of the households were still without power by Dec. 31.

The group estimates that 4,645 people died between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, 2017 as a direct or indirect result of the Category 4 storm, and one-third perished because of delayed or interrupted medical care. The researchers say even that estimate may be too low and the numbers “underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico.” The findings, reported online Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, are likely to be controversial because the tally is far higher than previous independent estimates, the margin of error is wide, and the emergency response to the disaster has become highly politicized after it sparked criticism of President Donald Trump, who promoted a much lower death toll and was faulted when much of the territory remained without power for months.

The storm and its winds of close to 150 miles per hour caused an estimated $90 billion in damage to an island that had been struggling economically. Many residents subsequently left. A closer look at the Buckee calculation shows that while the researchers estimate 4,645 deaths, statistically there’s a 95 percent chance that the actual number could be as low as 793 and as high as 8,498. When the researchers tried to adjust for the fact that people living in single-person households couldn’t report their own death, they estimated 5,740 excess deaths, with a margin of error ranging from 1,506 and 9,889. The Buckee number is more than four times higher than a December estimate by the New York Times, which reported that the actual death toll was probably about 1,052 excess deaths based on data from the island’s vital statistics bureau and a comparison of deaths during a comparable period in the two previous years. The count included suicides. At the same time, the Center for Investigative Journalism said it found 985 additional deaths during September and October. A Pennsylvania State University study put the number at 1,085 (which the Buckee team appears to misreport as 1,218). A CNN survey of funeral directors found 499 additional deaths. To come up with its dramatically-larger estimate, the Buckee team randomly conducted in-person surveys of 3,299 of the estimated 1.1 million Puerto Rican households earlier this year, making sure to include remote areas. Respondents were not paid and were asked if a household member had died directly or indirectly as a result of the storm. Missing people were not counted as deaths. They were also asked about deaths within a five-minute walking distance. More than 93 percent of the people approached completed the survey “Increases in post-hurricane death rates were observed across age groups and were not a reflection of the migration of younger persons out of Puerto Rico after the disaster,” the team reported. The Buckee team also said that households went, on average, 68 days without water, 84 days without electricity and 41 days without cell phone coverage. In the most remote areas, 83 percent of the households were still without power by Dec. 31. Just over 14 percent said they couldn’t get their medicines. The Times analysis found spikes in deaths from severe infections, diabetes, pneumonia, and breathing disorders such as emphysema. The 2018 hurricane season begins June 1.

The deal was reached among two court-appointed agents who have spent a year litigating over future sales tax revenues. Late on Tuesday, the parties filed a motion in Manhattan’s U.S. District Court announcing the deal and asking for any motions for summary judgments before the court to be held “in abeyance for a period of 60 days” or until Aug. 4. Details of the agreement were not revealed. “I am pleased with the settlement agreement... It is an enormous significant development,” Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is overseeing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy, said during a hearing on Wednesday. The bondholders, who together own about half of bankrupt Puerto Rico’s $71.5 billion in bonds, have spent years disputing ownership of future sales tax revenues. The U.S. territory declared the largest ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy in May 2017, under the jurisdiction of the special Puerto Rico financial rescue law known as PROMESA. “There is a lot of work that remains to be done. We are not at the finish line yet,” Luc Despins, a lawyer for the unsecured creditors committee told the court, adding details would be taken back to various creditor groups. Representatives of the financial oversight board created by PROMESA told the court they also supported the 60-day extension.

The effect has been favorable even for the GO bonds,” said Daniel Berger, senior market strategist Municipal Market Data, a Thomson Reuters company. In May, the oversight board snubbed a proposed settlement by two bondholder groups that would have split the revenues roughly evenly, calling it “completely unaffordable.” Shaun Burgess, a portfolio manager at Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors, noted the original deal gave senior COFINA bondholders a 93 to 95 cent on the dollar recovery value versus about 42 cents for the junior COFINA debt. “If some new deal has been reached you may be closer to that mark, which would fuel the move we have seen today. But without details it is very hard to know what the real driver is, so this move feels very speculative,” Burgess said.  Puerto Rico owes about $18 billion each in general obligation and COFINA debt. The dispute between the two sets of creditors is the central legal dispute in the island’s bankruptcy.

Bystanders snapped pictures and even stole a few touches of the enormous, 3-year-old colt before he returned to his stall to rest as he awaits his next assignment.That task could be to continue racing for the rest of the year, which is what American Pharoah did in 2015 after he, too, won the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont over the course of five weeks. Or it could be to stop racing for good and just get ready for the business of making serious money in the breeding shed.Justify, who never raced until this year and remains undefeated, has already earned $3.8 million on the track. And if he follows the same path that American Pharoah did, which is to keep racing this summer and fall in the Haskell Invitational, the Travers Stakes and the Breeders‚ Cup Classic, he could add millions of dollars to his winnings. He could even one-up American Pharoah by running in the $16 million Pegasus World Cup next January and still make it to the breeding shed in time for next spring‚s mating season.But the risk of injury that could derail his future as a sire is always present on the track, and the cost to insure a horse of his stature is astronomical. How astronomical? Maybe 3 to 5 percent of his current estimated value of $100-million plus. So while American Pharoah did keep racing for a while, in part because his owner relished the attention the horse was generating, the business-minded partnership that owns Justify may come to a different, more bottom line-focused, conclusion. It could decide that it makes no sense to let Justify ever race again, as thrilling as it might be to do so.‚Nothing has been settled,‚ said Elliott Walden, the chief president and chief executive of WinStar Farm, which owns the biggest share of Justify (60 percent).But consider the potential money at stake: The first year after winning the Triple Crown, American Pharoah commanded a $200,000 stud fee in the United States. With an average of 150 live foals from each spring breeding season in Kentucky, American Pharoah was racking up more than $30 million in annual stallion fees (although a reported two-mares-for-one deal could have cut that profit to about $15 million). Add to that the fact that American Pharoah then shuttles to Australia in the fall, commanding about $50,000 per live foal while he is stationed there.It is a huge amount of revenue, money that can be generated for years on end, and it helps explain why the sport of racing increasingly says goodbye to its star horses not long after they emerge.Back in 2015, Ahmed Zayat, the owner of American Pharoah, sold his breeding rights for $10 million before any of the Triple Crown races had been run. Had he waited until after American Pharoah had at least won the Derby, he likely would have secured much more for those rights. It is another reason, and maybe the biggest one, Zayat continued to race American Pharoah after he completed the Triple Crown ‚ he wanted to win more big purses at various tracks to make up for some of the breeding money he initially lost out on. In the case of Justify, the math is a lot different because a far larger deal for his breeding rights ‚ $60 million ‚ was concluded after he won the Derby but before he captured the Preakness and the Belmont. On one side of this deal were two of the horse‚s owners ‚ WinStar and China Horse Club ‚ along with SF Racing, a group backed by George Soros, the billionaire owner and philanthropist, that sold its ownership share of Justify but still owns some of the horse‚s breeding rights. On the other side of the deal was Coolmore, the breeding farm that also oversees American Pharoah‚s sire activities.People in racing with knowledge of the deal said it included a bonus of about $25 million were Justify to win the Triple Crown, which he then went on to do, and that it also allowed the multiple owners to retain some shares in the horse when he begins his career as a sire (a provision that also has benefited Zayat to the tune of millions of dollars). Walden has maintained that a deal for Justify‚s breeding rights has yet to be finalized. But he may be making that assertion because the partners, for tax benefits, are waiting until September to finalize it.For now, the owners of Justify ‚ which also includes Head of Plains Partners and Starlight Racing ‚ are taking a circumspect approach to the horse‚s future. In the wake of his Belmont triumph on Saturday, they said they were open to the idea of keeping him on the racetrack but wanted to be absolutely sure he was healthy after a whirlwind schedule in which he raced and won six times, beginning in mid-February.As he spoke to reporters on Sunday, Walden did seem seduced by the thought of seeing what else Justify, who will return to Churchill Downs in Kentucky on Monday, could accomplish on the track. ‚He‚s now become a household name and I‚m looking forward to his next race as much as you guys are,‚ he said.So for the moment, at least, he sounded just like Zayat, who showed up at Justify‚s barn on Sunday to congratulate the horse‚s trainer, Bob Baffert, who also trained American Pharoah. In thinking back to part of his rationale in allowing American Pharoah to keep running after the Triple Crown, Zayat said: ‚How do you deprive the sport of him? I felt on my watch, if he‚s happy, I‚ll keep him running. Honestly, I felt a little bit guilty that I had a stud deal and he had to retire at end of his 3-year-old season. It‚s kind of the economics of the business.‚When Affirmed won the Triple Crown in 1978, as the last horse to do so before American Pharoah, it was commonplace for Triple Crown champions to keep running, even as 4-year-olds. Affirmed not only raced, but also won Horse of the Year honors, at age 4.Now, the risk of injury that would short-circuit a lucrative career as a sire seems to loom a lot larger. There is also, of course, the risk of defeat, which takes away some of the invincibility of a Triple Crown winner. American Pharoah was in that invincible category until he lost the Travers Stakes in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., two months after winning the Belmont. ‚I was beating myself up when he lost in Saratoga,‚ Zayat said. ‚Genuinely, I was crying. I felt like, ‚Did I squeeze the lemon too hard?‚‚American Pharoah then rebounded to win the Breeders‚ Cup Classic and, still healthy, then went on to the breeding shed.As for Justify, if he were to keep racing, the cost to insure him would require a huge amount of money, and might swallow up a lot of the purses if he kept racing, and winning, for the remainder of 2018.‚Insurance is the great denominator here because he‚s worth more off the track than he‚s worth on the track,‚ John Patrick Unick, the senior vice president of equine and self-insured risk for the Insurance Office of America, said of Justify. ‚The only way the industry can ever get their arms around keeping these horses around longer is properly structuring insurance.‚On Sunday, Zayat joked with Baffert outside Justify‚s barn and said he was elated for what the trainer had accomplished ‚ two Triple Crowns in four years after there had been none for nearly 40. ‚It makes the dream alive,‚ Zayat said.Also exultant was Alex Waldrop, president and chief executive of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. ‚We need all the publicity we can get,‚‚ he said. Justify doing so well, he said, ‚brings nothing but positive attention to the sport.‚‚But for how long?","What‚Äôs Next for Justify? Maybe More Races, or Maybe Just the Breeding Shed","May 20, 2018 /  7:22 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-horseracing-belmont/horse-racing-justify-ready-for-some-rest-and-a-run-at-triple-crown-idUSKCN1IL0S9,"(Reuters) - Unbeaten Justify headed back to Churchill Downs on Sunday to rest up and train for a June 9 run at U.S. thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown.

I’m in awe of the horse.” And the chances of a run for the Triple Crown?. “Right now, I don’t see why not,” said Baffert, who with a victory in the Belmont Stakes would earn his second Triple Crown in four years after winning with American Pharoah in 2015. The Preakness was by far Justify’s toughest race as he endured not only rain and fog but strong competition at Pimlico Race Course. The three-year-old fought off a lengthy challenge from Kentucky Derby runner-up Good Magic, then withstood hard-charging Bravazo for a half-length victory. “He really had to work for it and I’m happy we pulled it out,” Baffert said. “He was blowing. You could tell he was in a fight the whole way. You can only get away with that when you have a superior horse like he is.” Although Justify did not have his best race and was noticeably tired at the end, Baffert would not necessarily agree that the longer Belmont Stakes would be an opportunity to derail his prized horse. “I think the next race will be really big,” the trainer said. “You can’t just bring it all the time. This will set him up for the next one.”  Already Preakness runner-up Bravazo and third-place finisher Tenfold are lined up to find out. Baffert said he planned to train Justify for the Belmont the same way he did American Pharoah. The colt will work out at Churchill Downs and likely ship to New York three days before the Belmont.  First there will be a few days’ rest.

21333455,2727,['2018-06-10t04:45:07.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/10/world/africa/south-africa-corruption-taxes.html,"PRETORIA, South Africa ‚ The nation‚s tax chief steeled himself. Chiding and pleading with President Jacob Zuma to get him to file his taxes ‚ much less pay the full amount ‚ was always an excruciating task.And it kept getting worse. One of the president‚s sons, a nephew and countless business allies had serious tax problems as well, four former senior officials said, alarming investigators and leaving them wondering what to do.South Africa‚s young democracy had depended on the faith ‚ and taxes ‚ of its people since the end of apartheid, so the risks were evident. If the leader of the African National Congress, his relatives and his influential associates could dodge their tax duties, the rest of the country might shirk them, too, hollowing out the government‚s ability to function at the most basic level.The tax commissioner, Ivan Pillay, said he tried to be discreet, visiting the president several times from 2012 to 2014 to prod him to comply. ‚If I am in the way, just tell me and I‚ll go,‚ Mr. Pillay said in a rare interview, recounting his conversations with Mr. Zuma. ‚I won‚t like it, but I‚ll go. I‚m a disciplined member of the A.N.C.‚Mr. Zuma demurred, insisting there was no need to resign, Mr. Pillay said. Instead, the president dealt with the issue himself a few months later: He abruptly replaced Mr. Pillay with a loyalist who led a sweeping purge of the tax agency, setting off a blistering national scandal that is threatening South Africa in unexpected ways.Wielding a barrage of fictitious news stories and doctored assertions by one of the world‚s biggest auditing firms, KPMG, Mr. Zuma managed to thwart scrutiny into his own taxes, his family‚s affairs and his allies‚ finances, according Mr. Pillay and three other former senior tax officials who confirmed the account.Then, the president and his supporters went even further. They used the upheaval at the tax agency to seize greater control over the National Treasury, further enriching themselves at enormous cost to the country, according to government officials now trying to repair the damage.The national tax agency, as prosaic as it may sound, had once been an extraordinary triumph, even for the party that helped defeat apartheid. Just a few years after it helped usher in democracy, the A.N.C. switched from liberation to the mundane workings of government and persuaded millions of South Africans to do the unimaginable: pay their taxes. In a barometer of support for the fledgling new government, tax collections rose year after year, eventually surpassing some benchmarks in much richer, more established democracies, including the United States. The scrappy agency, the South African Revenue Service, won plaudits from the World Bank, Princeton University and other rarefied corners of the world.‚It was the jewel in the state crown,‚ said Dennis Davis, a High Court judge who led a recent review of the tax system and sat on a panel in the mid-1990s to help Nelson Mandela establish the tax agency.‚What has happened subsequently,‚ he added, ‚is a very, very, very seriously sad story.‚ South Africa‚s version of the Internal Revenue Service is perhaps an unlikely setting for a national saga involving spies, spurned lovers, secret brothels, double agents and one of the biggest journalistic scandals of the post-apartheid era.But the story shows how an increasingly corrupt A.N.C. has undermined its own successes by betraying the very people who brought it to power.And the drama is far from over. In today‚s South Africa ‚ dangling precariously between dueling factions inside the A.N.C. ‚ the nation‚s new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is struggling to assert his authority and fulfill his pledge to root out corruption. He now stands knee-deep in a very messy fight to wrest the tax agency from the legacy of his predecessor, Mr. Zuma, and win back the confidence of an angry nation.With corruption and political warfare gutting the agency, more and more South Africans have simply stopped paying their taxes, a dangerous turn in a nation where tens of millions depend on government services that are already enfeebled by graft and misrule. In the eyes of many experts, the government‚s ‚ and the country‚s ‚ ability to right itself is at stake. The dismantling of the tax agency unfolded in full view of the astonished country, squandering so much of the public‚s dwindling trust that officials now wonder how they will be able to restore it.Once Mr. Zuma removed Mr. Pillay as acting commissioner in late 2014, he installed an ally who had been close to the president and his family for decades. Almost immediately, explosive leaks started coming from inside the tax agency, spicing up the pages of a major South African newspaper.The articles said Mr. Pillay had approved the creation of an illegal ‚rogue unit‚ that had planted bugs at Mr. Zuma‚s home to intercept his conversations.The news grew juicier by the week: Hush money was paid to a former spymaster during apartheid to keep quiet about the illegal espionage. The rogue unit even set up a brothel to go undercover, the reports claimed.As the shocking details emerged, Mr. Zuma‚s new tax commissioner, Tom Moyane, called on KPMG to investigate, giving it a nearly $2 million contract to uncover the truth. A year later, KPMG came back with its results, confirming widespread abuses of power.Trouble is, it‚s not clear any of it was true.The newspaper, The Sunday Times, later retracted its articles. KPMG was forced to publicly dismiss its own conclusions as well, admitting that it had essentially copied a memo from its client‚s lawyers and passed off the allegations as its own, fully investigated findings.‚Whoever pays the piper calls the tune, unfortunately,‚ said Bobby Johnston, the former chairman of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange who sits on a panel now investigating KPMG. The retractions came much too late for the tax agency. Mr. Pillay and leaders of the so-called rogue unit had already resigned or been forced out, undercutting the agency‚s capacity to investigate and pursue tax dodgers, according to current officials and independent tax experts. Hundreds of the tax service‚s best employees also left during the upheaval, many going into private practice, and some to tax agencies as far away as New Zealand.Even more damaging, the lurid tales of corruption and intrigue inside what was once an A.N.C. showcase of good governance contributed to sharp drops in the nation‚s tax collection: more than $6 billion short of what the government had expected in the previous two budget years.The shortfalls have left the nation with fewer resources to tackle its most pressing needs ‚ housing, education, health ‚ in a society that has grown even more unequal under the A.N.C.And in a stinging blow to the impoverished South Africans who have voted the party into power and kept it there for decades, the gaps have forced the government to raise the value-added tax on products for the first time since the end of apartheid ‚ a move expected to hurt poor people the most.Much of the national ire over the scandal has focused on KPMG, which helped the chaos along by rubber-stamping some explosive accusations that it could not prove. Now the firm is facing collapse in South Africa, raising withering questions about the role Western companies play in providing a sheen of legitimacy while enabling corruption. KPMG is facing two inquiries in South Africa, and a few weeks ago the country‚s auditor general terminated all contracts with the firm. Private banks like Barclays Africa, one of the largest on the continent, have also ended their relationship with KPMG, citing the risks to their reputations.Yet the fate of the tax agency is still up in the air. It is only one of many government institutions that have been weakened through years of infighting and corruption by the party that built them. The A.N.C. has especially chipped away at agencies and posts that hold the powerful accountable, like the national police, prosecutors and the public protector‚s office.But the tax service‚s fall was so dangerous that Mr. Ramaphosa, immediately after taking office in February, vowed to save the agency. He suspended Mr. Moyane, though the bitter, public fight to fire him is still being waged.The president‚s office has accused Mr. Moyane of meddling in the KPMG inquiry, misleading Parliament and failing to properly investigate allegations of corruption, money laundering and tax evasion by his own deputy ‚ charges that Mr. Moyane is preparing to rebut in court.‚The tragedy is that SARS was a world-class institution,‚ said Ismail Momoniat, the National Treasury‚s deputy director general for tax and financial sector policy. ‚Tax collection is very critical for nation building, because it‚s the kind of underlying foundation for the state.‚ The Politics of Tax EvasionFor the leader of a country that often symbolizes the historic pursuit of democracy in Africa and beyond, Mr. Zuma certainly seemed to have grown weary of it himself, current and former officials say. During one of his visits to the president, Mr. Pillay said, Mr. Zuma started off making small talk but was clearly exasperated, openly complaining about the questions lawmakers expected him to answer.‚He said, ‚Listen, I‚m so tired and tomorrow morning I‚ve got to go to Parliament,‚‚ Mr. Pillay recalled Mr. Zuma saying. The president had faced volleys of outrage, especially over the lavish use of public money to upgrade his private homestead.‚‚Why must I go and answer questions in Parliament? Putin doesn‚t go to Parliament to answer questions,‚‚ Mr. Pillay recounted Mr. Zuma saying.‚That‚s where he was‚ in terms of being open to scrutiny, Mr. Pillay said.On top of that, one of Mr. Zuma‚s sons was suspected of hiding profits from contraband cigarettes. Red flags had also emerged with a nephew‚s used-car business and a foundation established by one of Mr. Zuma‚s wives ‚ all of which caught the attention of tax investigators, the four former officials said.Mr. Pillay insisted that he never wanted to pursue Mr. Zuma directly through a formal investigation, but that the president seemed convinced otherwise.‚He got it into his head that we are monitoring him,‚ Mr. Pillay said.Mr. Pillay was no stranger to conflict. He had been a commander in the military wing of the A.N.C. in exile, and later coordinated a clandestine operation to smuggle weapons and people into South Africa. Years later, at the tax agency, he led enforcement operations, hiring a coterie of former spies, police agents and investigators to go after tax cheats aggressively. His efforts earned him international recognition.Under apartheid, people had avoided paying taxes altogether, many as a form of protest against the government. But democracy brought legitimacy and, with it, compliance, according to a World Bank study. Government records show that from the end of apartheid in 1994 through 2010, the number of people paying taxes nearly quadrupled. During the presidency of Thabo Mbeki, people cheated, of course, but the revenue service was largely protected from political interference, Mr. Pillay said. And while party loyalists enriched themselves in many ways, he said, ‚there was order at the trough.‚But under Mr. Zuma, especially in his second term, which began in 2014, corruption began consuming nearly every corner of government ‚ from the national utility giant, Eskom, to provincial agricultural departments, according to parliamentary hearings and the nation‚s former public protector. Inevitably, the tax agency‚s investigations into offenders, including Mr. Zuma‚s relatives and business allies, encountered stronger pushback, the former officials say.‚Almost every big tax evader we were after would pull a political leader,‚ Mr. Pillay said. ‚All sorts of politicians were unhappy with us. It became a perfect storm,‚ helping seal his removal as the nation‚s chief tax officer, he argued. He and two other former officials now face criminal charges in a case that many experts see as politically motivated.Neither Mr. Zuma nor his choice for a replacement, Mr. Moyane, agreed to be interviewed. But Mr. Moyane, a little-known development economist who had been plucked from running prisons to lead the tax agency, has strongly defended his independence.‚I am not lackey to anybody,‚ Mr. Moyane insisted on television. ‚I am a man of my own. I am not owned by anyone.‚ Even so, in his four years as the nation‚s top tax official, Mr. Moyane earned a national reputation as Mr. Zuma‚s hatchet man, still guided by his loyalties to A.N.C. leaders who believe in the supremacy of the party over the country.A former anti-apartheid operative as well, Mr. Moyane had known Mr. Zuma for nearly four decades. They met in Mozambique in the late 1970s, when Mr. Zuma led the A.N.C.‚s underground operations in exile. Their families were close, too.Barely two weeks after Mr. Moyane took office, the wild stories began appearing in The Sunday Times, fed by unnamed sources inside the tax agency. The paper reported that Mr. Pillay had created the rogue unit, and that the tax agency had paid a former spymaster nearly $230,000 to keep quiet about surveillance devices planted at Mr. Zuma‚s home.‚Spy Scandal. Blondes, Brothels and Rhinos,‚ blared one headline. In the article, an unnamed tax employee told the paper that an agent of the rogue unit had set up a brothel, and even hounded a colleague for the money he owed for ‚two blondes.‚The Sunday Times retracted most of the articles ‚ 18 months later. It settled with Mr. Pillay and another tax agency employee named in the accounts.But the coup de gr√¢ce had already been delivered.Citing the news reports, Mr. Moyane quickly suspended Mr. Pillay, who resigned a few months later. More than 1,000 other employees, most of whom had nothing to do with the so-called rogue unit, left in a wider purge that impaired the agency‚s ability to pursue big companies and other offenders. Many investigations into the tax problems of politically connected individuals came to a halt.The impact on the nation goes far beyond that, threatening to drag South Africa back toward the days when people looked at the state of their government ‚ and decided not to support it. While the tax agency blames the economy‚s slow growth and a drop in imports for the recent revenue deficit, it also acknowledges ‚a deterioration in compliance.‚ Businesses collected taxes on the goods they sold and the employees they hired, but then did not turn over the money to the government, the agency said.Beyond that, nearly half of the shortfall in the last budget year came from personal income taxes that officials had expected to collect but never did, according to the National Treasury.The trend worries the government, which relies heavily on personal income tax, about half of which is paid by the top 1 percent of South Africans. The tax agency says it has made one million calls to remind taxpayers of their obligation to pay.For Judge Davis, the leader of the recent review of the tax system, the erosion of the public‚s faith in the agency and the government itself has been striking. He had expected a recent amnesty program, which allowed taxpayers to declare their offshore wealth and avoid penalties, to net as much as $1 billion. But by the time the program ended last year, it had collected just over $265 million.‚When you asked people, ‚Why was that?‚‚ Judge Davis said, ‚there were two or three reasons that were given. One was the erosion of tax morality, which was caused by increasing levels of government corruption.‚‚Secondly,‚ he added, the tax agency had been so thoroughly gutted that ‚people said they‚re never going to get caught.‚ ‚Looking for Cover‚The scandal did not end with the wreckage at the tax agency. The torrent of unproved accusations gave Mr. Zuma and his allies enough ammunition to grab control over another prize ‚ the state coffers in the National Treasury. This chapter of the story, in particular, relied on the cooperation of a Western company that carried great weight and credibility in South Africa: KPMG.In December 2014, as The Sunday Times kept churning out headlines about the rogue unit, Mr. Moyane commissioned KPMG South Africa to investigate. A year later, the firm produced a report confirming that a division inside the agency ‚ officially known as the High Risk Investigation Unit ‚ had been set up illegally and gone rogue. It was the proof that seemed to justify Mr. Moyane‚s sweeping purge.A longtime partner and forensic auditor at KPMG, Johan van der Walt, led the investigation. He had joined the firm just a few months after Mr. Mandela was elected South Africa‚s first post-apartheid president in 1994, and over the years he had made a name for himself in many high-profile inquiries. Testifying in an arms-deal case involving Mr. Zuma, Mr. van der Walt described himself as a ‚bloodhound.‚Not surprisingly, Mr. van der Walt‚s dive into the tax agency focused on the leader of the so-called rogue unit, Johann van Loggerenberg. The two men, both Afrikaners, had carved out distinct roles for themselves in South Africa‚s new order. Now, they found themselves on opposite sides of a showdown roiling the nation.Mr. van Loggerenberg, the tax official, had an especially unusual background. Before joining the agency in 1998, he had worked as an undercover police agent. His work, venturing deep into organized crime, had left him estranged from his family.‚Even my parents believed I was a criminal,‚ he recalled.Back then, as a young man in his 20s, Mr. van Loggerenberg was aware that he had been ‚a beneficiary of the apartheid system,‚ he said, but he also saw himself playing a ‚part in the renewal of the country.‚ After his police unit was disbanded, he considered an offer from the national intelligence service. But a prominent A.N.C. acquaintance told him to consider the tax agency instead.South Africans, the A.N.C. member told him, had been liberated in 1994 but did not have social or economic freedom. The new government needed money to erase the legacies of apartheid. The thought stuck in Mr. van Loggerenberg‚s mind.‚The more taxes this government can bring in, the better equipped it will be to implement its programs to build homes and schools and hospitals,‚ he recalled the official telling him. ‚It has to work. It can‚t not work.‚By the time KPMG started digging into the tax agency, however, Mr. van Loggerenberg had become embroiled in a personal scandal that added even more fuel to the national bonfire.By his own admission, Mr. van Loggerenberg, who was leading an investigation into the tobacco industry, had a brief romantic relationship with a double agent ‚ a lawyer who represented a tobacco manufacturer and had also operated as a government informant.When that relationship came to a tumultuous end, the lawyer gave The Sunday Times her WhatsApp exchanges with Mr. van Loggerenberg. In them, the couple simultaneously fight and discuss a tax settlement with a political leader, further eroding the public‚s confidence in the tax agency.KPMG even took on the relationship in its report: ‚It may be that either party had clandestine intentions and that the ‚love‚ fired by physical and emotional sharing with each other was used to extract information of common interest (but with different application).‚ The KPMG investigation claimed to be exhaustive. Mr. van der Walt‚s team of ‚20 to 30 professionals‚ perused 860,000 emails and an ‚excess of 1.36 million documents,‚ according to the firm.One Friday evening, from 6 p.m. until past midnight, a KPMG team took out documents from the tax official‚s safe, creating a detailed inventory of each item.‚It was a clinical process,‚ Mr. van Loggerenberg, the tax agent, said of the interactions with KPMG and its lead investigator. ‚I was actually very hopeful that he would uncover the truth because of the reputation he had for being a meticulous forensic investigator.‚In the end, the 139-page KPMG report found no evidence of a brothel or illegal wiretapping of Mr. Zuma.But it argued that members of the so-called rogue unit had bugged the offices of national prosecutors in an operation called Project Sunday Evenings, eavesdropping on the investigation of a crime boss and a former police commissioner who wound up in prison.Equally important was a single sentence, in KPMG‚s executive findings and conclusions, about Pravin Gordhan, the man who was widely credited with building up the tax agency as its commissioner from 1999 to 2009. Mr. Gordhan, KPMG said, ‚ought to have known of the existence of the unit,‚ which it said had been established illegally.This sentence gave Mr. Zuma and his allies the tools to go after an even bigger target: the National Treasury, which Mr. Gordhan had moved on to oversee as finance minister. The authorities publicly summoned Mr. Gordhan in late 2016 and charged him with fraud.The charges were quickly withdrawn, but they gave Mr. Zuma political cover when he fired Mr. Gordhan from his post as finance minister a few months later.Mr. Zuma and Mr. Gordhan had often been at odds over the use of government money. Under Mr. Gordhan‚s stewardship, the National Treasury had become a bulwark against the freewheeling spending at state enterprises that was enriching Mr. Zuma‚s allies.Mr. Gordhan was widely respected in financial and business circles. But when he was ousted in March 2017, the president replaced him with an A.N.C. politician under whose leadership corruption had flourished in the Ministry of Public Enterprises.A few days later, South Africa‚s credit rating was downgraded to junk status, creating yet another major challenge for the nation. Just as the chaos at the tax agency was depressing tax revenues, it suddenly became more expensive for South Africa to borrow money, compounding its problems.From there, KPMG might have simply moved on to other government projects, had it not been for a surprising development. Emails leaked last year revealed the chummy ties between close Zuma allies and top KPMG officials. The supposedly ironclad audits KPMG had performed quickly fell under suspicion. Some of the companies the firm had cleared were even being investigated for money laundering and other illicit activities.Forced to audit itself, KPMG acknowledged that it did not have evidence to support the statement it had made about Mr. Gordhan, the finance minister Mr. Zuma had removed.In a staggering mea culpa, the firm said it was withdrawing the report‚s main conclusions and recommendations ‚ including the assertion that the investigative unit had been established illegally and was operating in a rogue manner.‚We recognize and regret the impact this has had,‚ the firm said last September. ‚KPMG South Africa had no political motivation or intent to mislead.‚Even more damning was KPMG‚s later admission in a hearing before Parliament that the report‚s conclusions and recommendations had not been the product of KPMG at all.Instead, they had been copied ‚by and large verbatim‚ from a memo drafted by lawyers employed by the tax agency, said Roy Waligora, KPMG South Africa‚s head of forensics.But the firm stopped short of disavowing other sections of the report, sowing even more national confusion over whether anything in it had actually been true. The lead investigator, Mr. van der Walt, left the firm last year. He declined to be interviewed.No other individual received more attention in the report than Mr. van Loggerenberg, the former head of the so-called rogue unit. But he said KPMG officials had never interviewed him, even after he ‚begged‚ on several occasions to present his side of the story.The legal problems facing Mr. van Loggerenberg and Mr. Pillay are not finished. Both still face criminal charges linked to Project Sunday Evenings, accused of eavesdropping on national prosecutors.Legal experts say the case appears politically motivated, part of a continuing attempt by the national prosecutors ‚ still led by a staunch Zuma ally ‚ to maintain the narrative of a rogue unit at the tax agency. In recent years, the National Prosecuting Authority, which has been compromised by intense meddling by A.N.C. politicians, has increasingly been used for political ends, the experts said.The national prosecutors‚ spokesman declined to comment.For KPMG, the inquiry into the tax agency was a lucrative and prestigious contract, bringing in about $2 million and giving the firm a toehold on future work in government. Now critics accuse it of acting as little more than a hired gun in this case, ready to craft reports that fit its client‚s wishes.The investigation was one of many scandals involving KPMG in South Africa and elsewhere. Federal prosecutors in New York indicted four of the firm‚s former employees on conspiracy and wire fraud charges in January.Last month, two British parliamentary committees said KPMG was ‚complicit‚ in endorsing the misleading financial statements made by Carillion, a construction giant that collapsed early this year. KPMG, the company‚s auditor for 19 years, never raised questions and signed off on management‚s ‚increasingly fantastical figures,‚ the committees said.Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, a British organization, said the KPMG case in South Africa provided the clearest example of a major Western auditing firm bending the rules to provide governments with ‚assurance services.‚ ‚What you saw‚ in South Africa, he said, ‚is the government very much looking for cover to do something that appears to have been broadly illegitimate, and in order to get some cover for that, looking to these international players to give a stamp of approval.‚ Restoring Taxpayer TrustIn the end, Mr. Zuma‚s own party turned against him.With opposition figures gaining control of the nation‚s biggest cities, the A.N.C. removed Mr. Zuma as president of the country in February. The corruption he presided over had become too much of a political liability ahead of elections next year.But pledges of transparency in the aftermath of the tax scandal have yielded little. John Veihmeyer, the chairman of KPMG International at the time, promised ‚an independent investigation‚ into the rogue unit report last September.‚Given the significance of the issues involved in this matter to the country of South Africa, and the damage our actions have caused, the public deserves to know the full facts as quickly as possible,‚ he said in a statement.But KPMG has not followed up in the eight months since Mr. Veihmeyer‚s pledge. KPMG International declined interview requests, saying only that it ‚continues to cooperate‚ with inquiries.That is not how some investigators describe it. Lawyers in one inquiry, conducted by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, were denied access to key documents, according to Dumisa Buhle Ntsebeza, who leads the organization‚s inquiry panel and once headed South Africa‚s Truth and Reconciliation Commission‚s investigation unit. ‚We‚re still stuck,‚ Mr. Ntsebeza said.Mr. Ntsebeza has also leveled his frustration at the new leadership of the nation‚s tax agency.At a recent hearing, the agency‚s new acting commissioner, Mark Kingon, delayed its start by a couple of hours in an attempt to expel journalists, though the hearings had been open to the public since the inquiry began early this year. Then, unlike all previous witnesses, Mr. Kingon refused to speak under oath.‚In order for us to be comfortable that you‚re serious about what you‚re saying, we need you to bind yourself to what you‚re going to say ‚ the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth,‚ Mr. Ntsebeza said, unable to conceal his anger.Now, South Africa is waiting to see how far its new president, Mr. Ramaphosa, will carry his anti-corruption drive. Many are skeptical, contending that he did little to prevent his fellow A.N.C. leaders from undermining the tax agency and other institutions during his nearly four years as Mr. Zuma‚s deputy president.Yet another inquiry, this one ordered by Mr. Ramaphosa, has promised to reveal the real, complete story behind the rise and fall of the tax agency. But it is far from clear whether it will restore the people‚s faith in government and persuade them to do what may seem, once again, unimaginable ‚ pay their taxes.‚We should put behind us the era of diminishing trust in public institutions and weakened confidence in leaders,‚ Mr. Ramaphosa said in his first address to the nation in February.",Corruption Gutted South Africa‚Äôs Tax Agency. Now the Nation Is Paying the Price.,"June 8, 2018 /  6:46 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-zuma/south-africas-zuma-says-corruption-charges-should-be-dropped-idUSKCN1J40O6,"DURBAN, South Africa (Reuters) - Former South African President Jacob Zuma told supporters on Friday that corruption charges against him should be dropped because he had done nothing wrong, after appearing in court for the second time relating to a $2.5 billion arms deal. Former South African president Jacob Zuma appears in court in Durban, South Africa, June 8, 2018. Marco Longari/Pool via REUTERSZuma was ousted by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in February after nine years in power. He now faces 16 charges of fraud, racketeering, corruption and money laundering relating to the deal to buy European military hardware after apartheid ended in 1994. At that time, he was a provincial official. The case is unusual because African leaders are rarely taken to court once they leave power, particularly when their own party remains in charge. But President Cyril Ramaphosa has made fighting corruption a priority since he took power in February as part of a reform agenda that aims to revitalize the economy and attract investment. Former South African president Jacob Zuma arrives at a court in Durban, South Africa, June 8, 2018. Marco Longari/Pool via REUTERSZuma’s lawyers say he will challenge the decision to prosecute the case. The speed with which prosecutors have moved against the 76-year-old is a sign of his waning influence since he was replaced by Ramaphosa, his former deputy. “It’s obvious that the case should not go on,” Zuma told supporters from a stage in Durban, where High Court Judge Mjabuliseni Madondo earlier adjourned the arms deal case until July 27 after a 15-minute procedural hearing. “I did nothing, there are people who just like to make trouble for me,” said Zuma, who remains popular in his Zulu heartland where the case is being heard.  Slideshow (7 Images)Zuma shook hands and laughed with supporters as he left the court. Outside, hundreds of supporters sang his name and waved placards, while religious leaders gave tributes to him. Zuma said he could reveal secrets about people who were still in power and who he said were corrupt. Lawyers for the state and the defense are yet to agree on a date for trial. The state says it could be ready in November. The national prosecutor this week turned down a request to delay Friday’s hearing pending the outcome of a separate court case over the state paying Zuma’s legal fees. Charges over the arms deal were filed but then set aside by the National Prosecuting Authority shortly before Zuma ran for president in 2009. After his election, his opponents fought a lengthy legal battle to have the charges reinstated, finally succeeding in 2016. Zuma’s supporters say the former president, whose nine years in power were marked by economic stagnation and credit rating downgrades, is the victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt.

Their total income from the various investments was between $82 million and $222 million, compared with a range of $89 to $201 million in 2016.The value of the assets owned by Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump does not count the debt accumulated to purchase the properties. Mr. Kushner divested some of his Kushner Companies assets by selling them to a trust controlled by his mother.The White House released the ethics disclosures of numerous top officials late Monday, as the public was focused on President Trump‚s meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore. Last month, the White House released Mr. Trump‚s financial disclosure, revealing for the first time a repayment of more than $100,000 to his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, in 2017, raising questions about whether his filing a year earlier had improperly omitted the debt.One asset that Mr. Kushner did divest before joining the administration was his stake in his family firm‚s flagship property at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Last month, The New York Times reported that the company was in negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management for a significant equity infusion. Brookfield‚s property arm is partly owned by the Qatar government.Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Abbe Lowell, who is Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump‚s ethics counsel, said, ‚Since joining the administration, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have complied with the rules and restrictions as set out by the Office of Government Ethics.‚Mr. Mirijanian added that they had not been involved in the various transactions that benefited them. ‚As stated on numerous occasions, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump removed themselves from their companies‚ operations and investment decisions when they entered government service,‚ he said.The biggest transactions disclosed Monday involved buying or selling real estate in New Jersey, Indiana and Pittsburgh. In September, a limited liability company called Quail Ridge purchased residential real estate in Plainsboro, N.J., for $5 million to $25 million, according to the report. Mr. Kushner entered into a note transaction with Bank of America for the same value range, holding it with other members of the limited liability company.The ethics filing also disclosed income generated by Ms. Trump. She earned $3.9 million from her stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened in the fall of 2016. That was roughly on pace with what she reported in the previous year, when her filing showed that the hotel had generated $2.4 million in income during its first eight months.The hotel, just steps from the White House, has prompted concerns from ethics experts, who worried that guests may be trying to curry favor with the president by staying there. Ms. Trump‚s financial disclosures also show that she earned more than $5 million from the entity that controls her brand, and about $2 million in severance from the Trump Organization. Ms. Trump has resigned from her leadership roles at her fashion business and her family‚s real estate company since her father became president.Ms. Trump also earned $289,300 as an advance for her book ‚Women Who Work.‚ She donated the money to the Ivanka M. Trump Charitable Fund, a ‚donor-advised fund‚ dedicated to organizations that focus on women and girls, according to the filing.The filing also disclosed a few interests that Mr. Kushner had divested but inadvertently failed to report previously, including Vegas Seven, a Las Vegas website, as well as a stake in Brooklyn Beer.","Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner Had a Busy Year in Investing, Filing Shows","May 23, 2018 /  10:12 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-kushner/trump-adviser-and-son-in-law-jared-kushner-gets-security-clearance-back-idUSKCN1IO3E5,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law, has had his security clearance restored, allowing him access to classified information after losing the privilege in the fallout over a fired White House aide, his lawyer said on Wednesday. White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner arrives for U.S. first lady Melania Trump's ""launch of her initiatives"" and ""Be Best"" campaign in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 7, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque When he joined the White House staff in January 2017, Kushner gained access to sensitive information through a temporary security clearance while the FBI conducted a background check to see if he qualified for a permanent clearance. His temporary clearance was suspended by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly in February along with other officials operating under temporary clearances as part of measures to tighten procedures after White House staff secretary Rob Porter was fired when his two ex-wives raised charges of domestic abuse. “With respect to the news about his permanent security clearance, as we stated before, his application was properly submitted, reviewed by career officials, and went through the normal process. Having completed these processes, Mr. Kushner is looking forward to continuing the work the president has asked him to do,” said Kushner attorney Abbe Lowell. Kushner is leading a Trump effort to resurrect the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and has been a Trump conduit to Mexico, among other activities. It took an unusually long time for Kushner’s background check to be completed, raising questions about whether he might be in trouble in U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Kushner,  who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, attended a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Donald Trump Jr., and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Lowell, in a statement, said Kushner has cooperated fully with the investigation, including sitting for two interviews with the special counsel’s office. “In each occasion, he answered all questions asked and did whatever he could to expedite the conclusion of all the investigations,” Lowell said. According to a person familiar with the situation, Kushner was interviewed for a second time by the Mueller team in the second week of April. It lasted more than six hours. The questions covered issues related to whether there was collusion between Russian figures and the Trump campaign, and any contacts during the Trump post-election transition period to the presidency, among other issues, the source said. According to the person, Mueller’s team did not ask questions about Kushner’s business or finances, including his family’s real estate company.

He is now in Walter Reed Medical Center,‚ Mr. Trump tweeted, just before a meeting in Singapore with North Korea‚s leader, Kim Jong-un.The White House issued a statement late Monday evening saying that Mr. Kudlow had a ‚very mild heart attack.‚ ‚Larry is currently in good condition at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and his doctors expect he will make a full and speedy recovery,‚ Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in the statement.A person familiar with the situation said that Mr. Kudlow had a stent inserted on Monday.Mr. Kudlow, a former CNBC commentator and Wall Street economist who has long championed free trade, has increasingly defended Mr. Trump‚s approach to trade policy, including his threat of tariffs. He did so most recently on Sunday cable news shows, where he defended Mr. Trump‚s war of words with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada after this weekend‚s fractious meeting of the Group of 7 industrialized nations.Mr. Kudlow, speaking Sunday on CNN‚s ‚State of the Union,‚ appeared to slur some words when discussing Mr. Trump‚s trade agenda after the Group of 7 meeting. Mr. Kudlow criticized Mr. Trudeau, saying the prime minister ‚really kind of stabbed us in the back‚ with comments critical of the United States in a news conference after the meeting.Mr. Kudlow had been home sick for part of the day on Monday. He did not respond to colleagues‚ calls and emails on Sunday ‚ a rarity ‚ and on Monday morning, an National Economic Council meeting was unexpectedly canceled.Colleagues said they had grown worried about Mr. Kudlow in recent days, particularly after a White House briefing last week, before the Group of 7 meeting, in which Mr. Kudlow appeared visibly tired and uncharacteristically frail. On Monday night, friends and colleagues expressed concern for his health. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, praised Mr. Kudlow in a brief interview. ‚Larry Kudlow is the salt of the earth, and a true patriot,‚ Mr. Hassett said. ‚And our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family tonight.‚Stephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation economist and longtime friend of Mr. Kudlow‚s, said in an email Monday night that ‚he‚s ok and will be back on the job,‚ in response to a question about Mr. Kudlow‚s condition.Mr. Kudlow is a smoker, and was sometimes seen outside the West Wing with a cigarette. He has told people the stress of the director‚s job has surprised him, in part because of the constant level of toxic infighting among White House advisers, which he was not expecting.Mr. Kudlow dove into the job with gusto, taking on a wide portfolio that included the president‚s roller-coaster trade agenda ‚ including on-again-off-again tariff threats against China, Mexico, Canada, the European Union and others ‚ and denuclearization negotiations with North Korea. But in recent days, he has complained of exhaustion to friends and reporters, while stressing how much he loved the job.A disciple of the supply-side economic theories of the economist Arthur Laffer, Mr. Kudlow struggled with drug and alcohol addiction in the early 1990s while chief economist at the Wall Street firm Bear Stearns. He found sobriety, in part through Catholicism, and then he found a comfortable niche as a television commentator, radio host and evangelist for the economic power of low taxes, light regulation and a strong dollar.He was an early fan of Mr. Trump‚s presidential campaign, and he helped shape its tax plan, along with Mr. Moore. After Mr. Trump‚s election, Mr. Kudlow was a loud and frequent champion of the tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law in December.‚He‚s an optimist, he‚s a markets guy, he always says profits are the mother‚s milk,‚ James Pethokoukis, a columnist for the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said when Mr. Kudlow was picked for the National Economic Council job. When markets are firing and growth is strong, he said, ‚that is energizing to him.‚ Mr. Kudlow replaced Gary D. Cohn, who resigned over objections to Mr. Trump‚s tariffs. But the choice of Mr. Kudlow was widely seen as a positive sign for the free-trade wing of the Republican Party and as an indication that Mr. Trump wanted to refocus his message on the strength of the economy and the $1.5 trillion tax cut plan before the midterm elections. Since taking over as director, Mr. Kudlow has given frequent television appearances praising the strength of the economy and crediting Mr. Trump‚s policies for it. Unlike many other Republicans, Mr. Kudlow has also defended Mr. Trump‚s aggressive trade stance while insisting the president really does want free trade.‚President Trump spent two days ‚ and this is something dear to my heart ‚ talking to these ministers, these heads of state about free trade,‚ Mr. Kudlow said Sunday on CBS‚s ‚Face the Nation,‚ referring to the Group of 7 summit meeting, ‚ending tariffs, ending tariff barriers, ending subsidies, stopping trade wars, moving toward fairness and unfair trading practices.‚‚We are the fastest growing economy in the G-7, and he has got a vision here,‚ he said. ‚He is probably going to be the best trade reformer in several decades the world has seen.‚",Larry Kudlow Suffers ‚ÄòVery Mild‚Äô Heart Attack,"June 13, 2018 /  5:01 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-kudlow/trump-economic-adviser-kudlow-discharged-from-hospital-after-heart-attack-idUSKBN1J92HZ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow was discharged from a Washington-area hospital on Wednesday, two days after he suffered a heart attack.

The president and the administration are happy Larry is back home and look forward to seeing him back to work soon,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. Kudlow had a heart attack on Monday and was treated at Walter Reed Medical Center in suburban Maryland.    Trump announced Kudlow’s heart attack in a tweet sent minutes before he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. On Tuesday, Sanders said Kudlow was in good condition. A longtime television commentator, Kudlow, 70, was hired by Trump in March to replace Gary Cohn as director of the National Economic Council. Kudlow joined the president at the Group of Seven summit in Quebec on Friday and Saturday. He defended Trump vigorously in media interviews on Sunday after the U.S. president’s harsh criticism of summit host Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Pro-independence activist Edward Leung walks inside a detention centre before leaving for the High Court for a sentencing hearing in Hong Kong, China June 11, 2018.  REUTERS/Bobby YipEdward Leung, 27, one of the leaders of a movement advocating Hong Kong’s independence from China, was jailed for six years for rioting and assaulting police in a 2016 overnight protest that turned violent. He was found guilty of rioting by a jury and had pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer. Two other activists, Lo Kin-man and Wong Ka-kui, were jailed 7 and 3.5 years respectively for rioting. About 130 people, mostly police, were injured when masked protesters tossed bricks and set trash cans alight to vent their anger against what they saw as mainland Chinese encroachment on the city’s autonomy and freedoms. The government quickly labeled the overnight unrest a “riot”. Leung has supported Hong Kong’s outright secession from China given Beijing’s perceived erosion of the “one country two systems” principle granting the city a high degree of autonomy since it was handed from British to Chinese rule in 1997. It wasn’t immediately clear if he would appeal against the sentence. Leung appeared calm upon hearing High Court Judge Anthea Pang announce the sentence, while murmurs of disbelief rippled through a crowd of about 150 activists and supporters watching a live broadcast outside the courtroom. Pang condemned the “severe” violence of the riot, which she said had caused “great danger” to those at the scene, and which warranted the imposition of a strict deterrent sentence. “The court absolutely does not allow livelihood or political disputes to be expressed through acts of violence,” she said. Rioting in Hong Kong is defined under the city’s Public Order Ordinance as an assembly of three or more people where any person “commits a breach of the peace”. This offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years behind bars, was last amended in 1970, a few years after a months-long pro-Communist riot against British rule killed at least 50 people, including children. Hong Kong’s most high-profile democracy activist, Joshua Wong, described the sentence on Twitter as harsh under “Hong Kong’s present era of political prisoners”. Wong himself was convicted of “unlawful assembly” under the Public Order Ordinance and served about two months in jail before the city’s top court quashed the imprisonment sentences in an appeal.   Pro-independence activist Edward Leung is held by a correctional services department officer inside a detention centre before leaving for the High Court for a sentencing hearing in Hong Kong, China June 11, 2018.  REUTERS/Bobby Yip“EXTREME SENTENCES” Leung’s sentence was also slammed by some international voices including Hong Kong’s last British governor Chris Patten. Patten noted that the Public Order Ordinance carried vague definitions that were being used against a slew of local activists since the “Umbrella Movement” protests paralyzed major roads in the city in late 2014. “It is disappointing to see that the legislation is now being used politically to place extreme sentences on the pan-democrats and other activists,” Patten said in a statement issued via the London based NGO, Hong Kong Watch.  Geoffrey Nice QC, a barrister who led the prosecution in the genocide trial of former Serbian and Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague, called the jail term against Leung “unjustified”. But a police representative disagreed Leung’s case amounted to political persecution. “The sentence reflects the gravity of the offence,” said chief inspector of the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau, Tse Tsz-kwan. RISING STAR   Although the court case does not deal directly with the issue of independence, the sentencing is likely to be seen as a broader warning against radical youth activism. Leung, then a student of philosophy at the University of Hong Kong, came to public prominence after the 2016 protests, and contesting a legislative council by-election that year. He was barred from running for another election later that year. China has repeatedly slammed the independence movement, fearful of the idea catching on in the mainland. President Xi Jinping warned last year that any attempt to endanger China’s sovereignty would be an act that crosses a “red line”. Leung’s sentence came one week after two other pro-independence activists and former lawmakers were sentenced to one month in jail for assembling illegally in the legislature while still in public office.

FILE PHOTO: Edward Leung, a candidate from the Hong Kong Indigenous, chants slogans on the podium before the final poll result is announced in Hong Kong, China February 29, 2016.   REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File PhotoThe closely watched case concerned an overnight protest in 2016 that turned violent, injuring about 130 people, mostly police, when masked activists threw bricks and burned trash cans to vent anger at what they saw as China’s encroachment on the former British colony’s culture and autonomy. The prosecution argued that Edward Leung played a leading role in inciting what it called a riot, but Leung said he was only trying to support hawkers selling street food and protect people on the scene when police used force. Leung’s lawyer, Edwin Choy, said he was unhappy with the verdict but had not discussed an appeal.     “He should be cleared of the charge (of rioting),” Choy said. “His speech and action ... did not amount to a breach of peace.” The jury, after about 25 hours of deliberation, cleared him of inciting a riot and failed to reach a decision on another rioting charge. Each rioting charge carries a maximum term of 10 years.  He had earlier pleaded guilty to one charge of assaulting a police officer, which carries a maximum sentence of two years. Sitting in the dock, Leung, 26, tilted his head back, closed his eyes and smiled when he was cleared of the incitement charge. Cheers erupted from a crowd of at least 50 people watching the trial streamed live outside of the courtroom.

A hearing on mitigation for the pair has been set for Monday before the court decides on a date for sentencing. LAW “IN NEED OF REFORM”  Hong Kong law defines a riot as an unlawful assembly of three or more people where any person “commits a breach of the peace”.  This offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years behind bars, was last amended in 1970, a few years after a months-long pro-Communist riot against British rule killed at least 50 people, including children. FILE PHOTO: Hong Kong Indigenous member Edward Leung speaks after being disqualified from running in the Legislative Council elections in Hong Kong, China, August 2, 2016. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File PhotoBritish-based NGO Hong Kong Watch said the law was “urgently in need of reform because it is being used to disproportionately punish political protesters in Hong Kong”. Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including an independent judiciary. Leung was a leader of Hong Kong Indigenous, a political group that organizes anti-China protests and advocates “localism”, promoting a local Hong Kong identity instead of a Chinese one. Another leader of the group, Ray Wong, was also charged with rioting, but he had skipped town. Leung’s rise and fall echo the ebbs and flows of the city’s radical youth activism following the pro-democracy “Umbrella Movement” protests in 2014 that saw major roads occupied for months. He also supported and promoted Hong Kong independence and Friday’s verdict is likely to deal a further blow to the movement that has lost much of its steam amid a series of court cases fought by activists and lost. Communist Party leaders in Beijing have repeatedly slammed calls for independence, fearful of the idea catching on in the mainland. President Xi Jinping warned last year that any attempt to endanger China’s sovereignty would be an act that crosses a “red line”. Only 3 percent of some 1,300 university students polled in March supported Hong Kong independence, while about 12 percent backed “localism”, according to a survey conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  Most students, over 50 percent of them, said they did not have any political leaning.  A different study conducted by the university in 2016 showed that one in six people, or 17 percent, supported independence, while 58 percent opposed it. The poll surveyed about 1,000 people over 15.

Magistrate Wong Sze-lai said during sentencing at the Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts that their actions had “directly damaged the legislature’s integrity,” local broadcaster RTHK reported.  The pair first said they would appeal, but Yau later changed her mind, according to RTHK. Two assistants also chose not to appeal.

It also cited crossbench peer David Alton calling the sentence “a major over-reaction.” “Imagine if a Member of Parliament were sent to jail for staging a protest inside Parliament,” he said.

Alarmed by the dissent, Beijing’s Communist Party leaders tightened control over the city, discouraging pro-democracy supporters. Leung and Yau lost much public support after they insulted China during their swearing-in. The Hong Kong government accused them of making invalid oaths, and a court disqualified them from their posts in 2016. As court proceedings were underway, the highest body in China’s parliament, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, issued a controversial legal interpretation about oath-taking, which triggered a protest by nearly 2,000 lawyers against Beijing’s “interference.” Hong Kong’s most high-profile student activist, Joshua Wong, was jailed for roughly two months for unlawful assembly before he was freed in February by Hong Kong’s top court, which warned that future offenders would be subject to harsher sentences. Hong Kong laws define unlawful assembly as one where three or more people conduct themselves in a “disorderly, intimidating, insulting or provocative manner” likely to cause others to reasonably fear “a breach of the peace.”  It is “immaterial” if the original assembly was lawful if the people assembled ended up behaving in such a manner, the law stated.

Only months ago, the Chilean scandal represented an enormous threat to the pope‚s credibility. Now, abuse victims and their advocates express hope that a new era is beginning in which bishops and the church hierarchy will be held accountable for covering up and ignoring abuse.‚Today begins a new day for the Catholic Church in Chile and hopefully the world,‚ Juan Carlos Cruz, a victim of the Rev. Fernando Karadima, one of Chile‚s most notorious abusive priests, wrote on Twitter on Monday. The priest was a mentor of Bishop Barros, who Mr. Cruz says witnessed his abuse and did nothing. Mr. Cruz added that Francis, whom he has met with for hours of private and emotional talks in recent weeks, ‚has started the firing of bishops who are abusers or have covered up. We hope this is the beginning of the end of this culture of abuse and cover up in the Church. Emotional but great day!‚ The pope also accepted the resignations of Cristi√°n Caro Cordero, bishop of Puerto Montt, and Gonzalo Duarte Garc√≠a de Cort√°zar, bishop of Valpara√≠so, both of whom are 75, the mandatory retirement age for bishops in the church. Bishop Barros, who is accused of witnessing and covering up abuse, is 61. He denies the allegations against him.The removal of the bishops could herald what many church observers predict will be widespread firings of Chile‚s bishops, all of whom tendered their resignations in May. The pope has already lamented the country‚s ‚culture of abuse and cover-up.‚Francis had moved Bishop Barros from Chile‚s military diocese to the southern diocese of Osorno in 2015, a decision that prompted outrage from local Catholics and from victims of Father Karadima, whom the Vatican found guilty of sexually abusing minors in 2011.At the time, the country‚s largely Socialist-led Parliament sought to block the installment of Bishop Barros. That move apparently prompted Francis to say, in recorded remarks, ‚Think with the head, don‚t be led around by the nose by these leftists.‚ The pope doubled down on his defense of Bishop Barros in January during a trip to Chile, in which he said he had never seen any proof against the bishop. Remarkably, some of Francis‚ closest associates, including Cardinal Sean O‚Malley of Boston, the city at the center of the abuse crisis in the United States, distanced themselves from the pope. Pressure on Francis continued to build in the days after his return to Rome. He then sent Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, the Vatican‚s leading sex crimes investigator, to talk to Mr. Karadima‚s victims in the United States and in Chile about Bishop Barros. Archbishop Scicluna spoke to 64 people and gave Francis a 2,300-page report that led the pope to issue an extraordinary apology. ‚I have made serious errors of judgment and perception of the situation, especially due to lack of truthful and balanced information,‚ Francis wrote.He added that replacing bishops was ‚necessary‚ but not enough, and he accused Chile‚s hierarchy of destroying evidence in cases of clerical sexual abuse and moving abusive priests from parish to parish.Other bishops accused of covering up abuse include Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati of Santiago, the Chilean capital, and Bishop Alejandro Goic, who until weeks ago served as president of the Chilean church‚s National Commission for the Prevention of Abuses.In Geneva on Thursday, advocates against clerical abuse announced the formation of a new international group, End Clergy Abuse, and demanded that Pope Francis bring back plans to create a Vatican tribunal to hold bishops accountable for covering up or failing to root out abuse.Aggressive prosecutions of prelates in Australia, police raids on the offices of an American diocese, and a large-scale investigation in England have led some experts to note that civil authorities no longer appear to see church leaders as untouchable. The questions of how the Vatican will deal with its own hierarchy and whether Francis has really seen past his blind spot remain, however.Advocates say they are hopeful. This week, Archbishop Scicluna will head back to Chile and is expected in Bishop Barros‚s diocese on June 14. His visit is being described by the church as a ‚process of reparation and healing.‚",Pope Accepts Resignation of Chilean Bishop Tied to Abuse Scandal,"June 11, 2018 /  10:43 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-abuse-pope/pope-francis-accepts-resignations-of-three-chilean-bishops-idUSKBN1J715H,"VATICAN CITY/SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Pope Francis has accepted the resignations of three Chilean bishops following sex abuse scandals, including Bishop Juan Barros of Osorno, the city at the center of the uproar, the Vatican said on Monday.

A Vatican official said Monday’s move represented a first step toward re-ordering the battered Roman Catholic Church in Chile and that the pope was still considering the positions of the other prelates. Besides 61-year-old Barros, the pope also agreed to the departures of Cristian Caro Cordero, bishop of Puerto Montt, and Gonzalo Duarte García de Cortazar, bishop of Valparaiso, who had both reached the normal retirement age of 75.  Church administrators were appointed to run all three dioceses. Barros, who has always denied allegations he witnessed and covered up sexual abuse cases, asked for forgiveness for his “limitations” in handling the scandal in a statement. He asked the Virgin Mary “that one day the whole truth will shine forth.” Bishop of Valparaiso Gonzalo Duarte Garcia de Cortazar, is seen in the street in Valparaiso, Chile March 28, 2018.

Juan Carlos Claret, spokesman for a group of lay Catholics in Osorno who fought for Barros’ removal from office, said it was a “minimum condition” that they had sought from the pope.  “The pope has a big challenge to guarantee that this cannot happen again,” he told Reuters by phone. “A pope could come into office that doesn’t care about these things, that’s why concrete changes have to be made.” He called for judicial authorities to examine whether some abusers, or those who helped cover up abuse, could be prosecuted. “The resignation of these bishops should not dilute their criminal responsibility,” he said. “They shouldn’t leave their posts to go home; some of them should go to prison. The pope has statements in his possession (from his investigators) that contain allegations of crimes we don’t even know about.”  FILE PHOTO: Pope Francis attends a meeting with faithful of the diocese of Rome at Saint John Lateran Basilica in Rome, Italy May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile/File PhotoJaime Coiro, general secretary of the Chilean Catholic Church, noted that the pope has said the case will require short-, medium- and long-term measures, which could include accepting the resignations of more bishops. “We can’t rule out the possibility that he could take further steps,” Coiro added.   Pope Francis last month promised to Chilean Catholics scarred by a culture of clergy sexual abuse that “never again” would the church ignore them or the cover-up of abuse in their country. The scandal revolves around Father Fernando Karadima, who was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing boys in Santiago in the 1970s and 1980s. Now 87 and living in a nursing home in Chile, he has always denied any wrongdoing. Victims accused Barros of having witnessed the abuse but doing nothing to stop it. Barros was named bishop of Osorno in 2015 by Pope Francis, who ignored objections from some clergy and churchgoers. During a trip to Chile in January, the pope staunchly defended Barros, saying he believed he was innocent, and that accusations against him were “slander” until proven otherwise. But days after returning to Rome, a chastened pope, citing new information, sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims, witnesses and other church members.  He produced a 2,300-page report which accused Chile’s bishops of “grave negligence” in investigating allegations that children had been abused and said evidence of sex crimes had been destroyed. Scicluna is due to return to Chile this week to gather more information.

On Tuesday, Judge Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington said aloud what most antitrust experts had been thinking for months: The government‚s case was a losing one.He repeatedly used the phrase ‚the government fails‚ in his 172-page decision. His ruling was peppered with exclamation marks.Judge Leon ruled forcefully, approving the deal with nary a concession by AT&T and Time Warner and admonishing the government that it shouldn‚t seek an emergency stay. Now, the yearlong effort to block the agreement will almost certainly be seen through a political prism of speculation about what motivated it, given President Trump‚s well-established distaste for the merger.Perhaps the greatest irony of the AT&T and Time Warner deal is the role reversal of those who rooted for it and those who fought it. Some Democrats, members of the party that usually condemns such big mergers, found themselves pushing for the deal to be approved, in part because Mr. Trump opposed it. And some Republicans, members of the party that champions free-market theory, looked for a reason ‚ any reason ‚ to block it.Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, a nonprofit opposed to government intervention, twisted himself into a remarkable explanation for why the government should get involved.‚America‚s consolidated corporate media monopolies have launched an all-out assault on democracy by trying to stamp out the expression of any ideas that don‚t fall in line with liberal-determined political correctness,‚ he wrote in September, saying that the addition of CNN to AT&T would crowd out conservative viewpoints.The deal wasn‚t even signed back in October 2016 when Mr. Trump turned it into a political football a few weeks before the election. On the same day that AT&T reached an agreement with Time Warner, Mr. Trump jumped on the headline with a campaign-trail proclamation. ‚As an example of the power structure I‚m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it‚s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,‚ he said. He also took shots at CNN as ‚fake news‚ and made derisive comments about its leader, Jeff Zucker. Even after Mr. Trump‚s victory, his opposition appeared to be bluster ‚ until it wasn‚t.The president has insisted that it wasn‚t his decision to fight the deal, contending that Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, had come to his own conclusion about the dangers of the proposed merger.‚Personally, I‚ve always felt that that was a deal that‚s not good for the country,‚ Mr. Trump said in November. ‚But I‚m not going to get involved. It‚s litigation.‚Of course, speculation has continued unabated that Mr. Trump was behind the suit. It didn‚t help last month when Rudolph W. Giuliani, a member of Mr. Trump‚s legal team, told HuffPost that ‚the president denied the merger.‚He backtracked afterward, saying he hadn‚t been properly informed. ‚He told me directly he didn‚t interfere,‚ Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. Trump.Was it one of those? Or something in between? We still don‚t know.And that‚s the problem. The calculus for companies considering mergers ‚ or any decision ‚ shouldn‚t be whether they think a president will seek to block or approve it on a whim.Mr. Trump‚s immediate praise of the Walt Disney Company‚s proposed acquisition of a big chunk of 21st Century Fox ‚ which is owned by his pal Rupert Murdoch ‚ only added to the sense that he is the one pulling the regulatory strings. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said at the time of that agreement that Mr. Trump believed ‚ ‚to use one of the president‚s favorite words ‚ that this could be a great thing for jobs.‚ Ms. Sanders added that Mr. Trump was ‚hoping to see a lot more of those created.‚ It empirically will do the opposite. If Mr. Delrahim‚s reasons for seeking to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal were genuine, Mr. Trump‚s behavior only undermined the credibility of his own people. (Mr. Delrahim has seemed to hint that he was amenable to a Disney-21st Century Fox deal, putting him in line with his boss.)Now the government has lost its case, and companies across the world are spinning up all sorts of megadeals to pursue on their assumption that Mr. Trump‚s administration won‚t want to risk losing again.They may be right. Mr. Trump doesn‚t like to lose, and that could make his administration more reluctant to police future deals that actually deserve to be blocked.That would be a mistake ‚ and the lasting legacy of a case that never should have been brought.",The Political Legacy of a Failed Challenge to the AT&T-Time Warner Deal,"June 12, 2018 /  9:21 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/time-warner-ma-att-antitrust/update-1-ma-gates-open-with-judges-blessing-on-att-time-warner-merger-idUSL1N1TE2BY,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday gave a ringing endorsement to AT&T Inc’s planned acquisition of Time Warner Inc without any conditions, opening the door for companies such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc to pursue deals to buy creators of media content.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationThe ruling by Judge Richard Leon bit.ly/2Jxx6qE of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia brings an end to a six-week antitrust trial in which U.S. regulators argued that the $85 billion deal would give AT&T undue leverage against rival cable providers that relied on Time Warner's content. The judge’s strong approval, and scathing opinion that urged the government not to seek a stay if they opposed the ruling, will give telecommunications providers the confidence that similar types of acquisitions will also have a shot at clearing regulatory hurdles, and could spur other copycat mergers this year, industry analysts and dealmakers said.  Investors are now also expecting major media consolidation, with Twenty-First Century Fox Inc shares rising more than 6 percent in after-market trading. Cable network owner Discovery Inc saw shares increase 3.2 percent while mobile providers, Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, which are waiting for a government approval of their own, also saw a bump following the decision. AT&T said that controlling Time Warner’s cable brands will help it craft new types of content to retain its customers as web-based rivals like Netflix Inc woo audiences away from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.  For cable companies feeling the pain of cord-cutting, similar deals for coveted media brands could help them build out new content offerings and offset expected declines in revenues, analysts and dealmakers told Reuters.  Related CoverageAT&T legal win could spur another jumbo bond; more M&AsFox shares pop ahead of expected Comcast bidInstant View: Federal judge OKs AT&T takeover of Time WarnerThe Justice Department had argued that AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner would allow it to charge premium prices to rivals who relied on its Turner and HBO channels to woo customers to their cable plans, potentially giving it an unfair advantage in the pay-TV market. Now this will be a less of a concern for companies.  “This decision could serve as a ‘green light’ for other potential M&A, including Comcast’s ongoing pursuit of FOX,” said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS, in a note.  Regulators will still likely scrutinize similar deals, and there is no guarantee that the district court’s approval of AT&T’s merger with Time Warner means that other major media acquisitions would be approved, several antitrust attorneys told Reuters.  Still, at least one company, Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, had been waiting for the court decision before making any large M&A moves in media, sources have said. Smartphone with AT&T logo is seen in front of displayed Time Warner logo in this picture illustration taken June 13, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationRival cable company Comcast is now likely to go ahead with its planned attempt to woo Fox away from Walt Disney Co, which said it would acquire most assets of the media company for around $50 billion last year.  “Regardless of what happens on the appeal front, expect Comcast to put forth an all-cash bid in the next day or so at a premium to Disney,” said Mary Ann Halford, senior adviser to OC&C Strategy Consultants. Comcast is aiming to gain control over Fox assets such as its Twentieth Century Fox Film and TV studios, which includes brands ranging from X-Men to The Simpsons, as well many of its cable networks. The court ruling could also open the door for Verizon, AT&T’S main rival, to bid for a media company, UBS’ Hodulik added.  However, in Verizon’s most recent quarterly earnings call, executives said they would rather sit out the current consolidation, and instead build out its content offerings through partnerships with independent media companies.  It also appointed a new chief executive officer earlier this month, Hans Vestberg, the company’s chief technology officer, in a move that signaled Verizon would likely double down on its existing telecommunications business. Still, one potential target for Verizon would be a combined CBS Corp and Viacom Inc, analysts have said, assuming that on ongoing legal battle between CBS’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and the company’s board, is resolved. In a recent court filing, Redstone said her long-term plan was to create a combined company, which would unite media assets including CBS’ broadcast networks, Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, and then sell it.

Read the latest on the bid here.]The battle for the future of media has begun.A judge‚s approval on Tuesday of the $85.4 billion AT&T-Time Warner deal is sure to touch off a series of mergers as once-powerful news and entertainment companies, built for an era when cable was king, position themselves to compete against the likes of Netflix, Amazon and YouTube.How quickly are things changing? Netflix recently surpassed Disney to become the most valuable media company at $158 billion.That helps set the stakes for the pending clash between Comcast and The Walt Disney Company as each seeks to own the bulk of 21st Century Fox. In December, Disney struck a $52.4 billion, all-stock deal to buy much of 21st Century Fox‚s assets. Now, Comcast plans to announce its own offer for 21st Century Fox‚s assets as early as Wednesday, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss company business. Shares of 21st Century Fox jumped more than 7 percentage points in early trading Wednesday. Comcast‚s stock price fell about 3 percent, while Disney gained about 1 percent.The contest will pit Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, against Disney‚s Robert A. Iger in what could be a fierce bidding war for a significant chunk of Rupert Murdoch‚s media empire.[Read about the AT&T-Time Warner ruling here.]Comcast, which already owns NBCUniversal, has put together a bid of slightly more than $60 billion in cash and contractual assurances that Fox would be paid what is known as a reverse breakup fee ‚ perhaps as much as $2.5 billion ‚ in the event a transaction is blocked by the government, the people said. But any regulatory concerns may be allayed by the straightforward approval of the AT&T-Time Warner deal. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington said the agreement could go through without either company divesting any assets.It is hard to overstate how closely Comcast was monitoring the situation. Executives at NBCUniversal had dispatched people to wait in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Mr. Roberts waited at his executive offices at Comcast‚s headquarters in Philadelphia, tuned to CNBC and keeping an eye on Twitter. According to a person familiar with the matter, Comcast‚s board met Tuesday evening to discuss its revamped bid for Fox, which rebuffed an overture last year.[The AT&T-Time Warner case showed the need to reboot antitrust law, our columnist writes.]In November, Mr. Roberts traveled to Mr. Murdoch‚s estate in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, according to two people familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because it has not been made public. There, over glasses of wine produced from vineyards on the estate, Mr. Roberts broached the possibility of Mr. Murdoch making a deal with Comcast. Mr. Murdoch explained that talks with Disney had already begun, but that the companies were still $4 billion apart on price. Mr. Murdoch said he had wanted $56 billion, which Mr. Roberts then offered, according to the two people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Murdoch said he would take it to the board.The  all-stock offer, which ultimately was worth about $60 billion, was rebuffed by Fox, in part because of regulatory concerns and the lack of a reverse breakup fee. The agreement with Disney came not long after.The businesses that Mr. Murdoch has agreed to sell include the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, almost two dozen regional sports networks like the Yankees‚ YES channel, a lineup of cable networks that includes FX and a 30 percent ownership stake in the streaming service Hulu.A deal would also include Fox‚s 39 percent ownership stake in the European pay TV operator Sky. Comcast has already made an offer to buy the other 61 percent of Sky in a separate deal. (The Fox News cable network, the Fox broadcast stations, the Fox Business Network and the sports network FS1 would not be part of a transaction.)Mr. Murdoch sees Disney‚s stock as ultimately more valuable than Comcast‚s, according to two people familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was still in process. Since Disney‚s bid is in stock, Mr. Murdoch is banking on a rise in the company‚s value over time. Comcast‚s all-cash offer would also mean an immediate tax hit.Still, Mr. Murdoch‚s son James, the chief of 21st Century Fox, told analysts in May that the company‚s leaders would consider all legitimate proposals. ‚The directors are very aware of their responsibilities,‚ he said. The younger Mr. Murdoch will leave the company if the Disney deal were completed.Each man vying for a piece of Fox is an accomplished dealmaker.Mr. Roberts spends a great deal of time analyzing merger possibilities and is always on the hunt. One of Comcast‚s most successful transactions was for control of NBCUniversal in 2011. In 2014, he bid for Time Warner Cable but walked away after the Justice Department said it was leaning toward blocking the deal. As the head of Disney, Mr. Iger has completed several major acquisitions, including the purchases of Pixar Studios, Lucasfilm and Marvel Entertainment, though all were private transactions that did not require approval of public shareholders.The Fox board has scheduled a shareholder meeting for July 10 to vote on the Disney offer, but that meeting could be moved back if Comcast makes its bid, as it is expected to do as a result of Tuesday‚s ruling.AT&T‚s victory shows the way forward for the media industry, which has grappled with a sharp slowdown in the past few years. The decline in pay TV subscribers has blunted businesses once thought to be invincible. ESPN, owned by Disney, has seen a significant drop in viewership as younger viewers spend more time on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.Mergers will allow companies to compete for costlier rights to professional sports, seen as perhaps the only way to keep viewers from cutting the cable cord, and to build out their streaming services.The pay TV industry may not be dying, but it is ‚slowly grinding down,‚ said Michael Nathanson, a founder of research firm MoffettNathanson.Besides the coming fight over 21st Century Fox, CBS and Viacom are locked in a will-they or won‚t-they situation, hinging on one of the bitterest boardroom fights in recent memory. Discovery‚s $11.9 billion purchase of Scripps last year seems modest by comparison, since both of those companies revealed weak performance at the time of the merger.Mr. Nathanson said he thought Disney will ultimately succeed in its pursuit of Fox because it has less debt than Comcast.‚But at some point, if the bid is too high from Comcast,‚ he said, ‚then Disney will have to walk away.‚",Comcast and 21st Century Fox in Focus After AT&T-Time Warner Approval,"June 13, 2018 /  11:30 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-comcast-finance/comcast-prepares-financing-for-21st-century-fox-buy-idUSKBN1J93BB,"NEW YORK (IFR) - Comcast says it has “Highly Confident Letters” from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo for its US$65bn 21st Century Fox bid.

Comcast said its all-cash proposal is not subject to a financing condition. It is proposing to acquire 100% of outstanding shares of 21st Century Fox for US$35.00 per share in cash.  It also said it would reimburse the US$1.525bn break-up fee paid to 21st Century Fox by Disney for a total cost to Comcast of US$4.025bn in the “highly unlikely” scenario that Comcast’s transaction does not close.  The deal will take Comcast’s net leverage to above four times, according to executives speaking on a conference call Wednesday.  A company flag flutters over Fox Studios in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2018. REUTERS/Mike BlakeThat number would include the leverage incurred from Comcast’s acquisition of Sky, which the US media company is also hoping to buy.  One analyst on the call expressed surprise at the proposed increase in leverage, noting the company has been “historically conservative on the leverage front”.   Comcast executives said they plan to cut net leverage by half a turn each year with free cash flow to arrive at 2.2x.  “We are very focused on getting our leverage back down,” one Comcast executive said.  The company is expecting to maintain its investment-grade rating. Moody’s has warned it may cut Comcast’s A3 rating, citing concerns about higher debt levels, especially in light of Comcast’s simultaneous US$30bn all cash bid for Sky.

But the decision has potentially bigger ramifications: It will shorten the time frame the office has to use a powerful law when pursuing securities fraud claims.A spokeswoman for Barbara D. Underwood, the acting New York attorney general, said in a statement that the ruling‚s effects would be limited because most of the office‚s cases against Wall Street firms are brought in a timely fashion. ‚We don‚t anticipate this impacting our cases in any significant way,‚ the spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick, said. ‚We intend to move forward all of our existing investigations and prosecutions.‚In a dissenting opinion, Jenny Rivera, an associate judge on the Court of Appeals, said she believed that the State Legislature had intended for a six-year statute of limitations to apply to the Martin Act. She said that in light of the ruling by her colleagues, the Legislature should make the law explicitly clear on that point.‚It now falls to the Legislature to correct this error before significant damage is done to the state‚s securities markets,‚ Judge Rivera wrote.The nearly 100-year-old Martin Act gives the New York attorney general broad authority to investigate and prosecute fraudulent securities sale practices. Over the past 15 years, a succession of attorneys general have used it to go after Wall Street banks for everything from publishing flawed stock research to selling faulty mortgage products during the run-up to the financial crisis.The law was the basis for much of the high-profile lawsuit filed against Credit Suisse in 2012 by the attorney general at the time, Eric T. Schneiderman. In the lawsuit, he said Credit Suisse had ‚deceived investors‚ about the quality of the mortgages it packaged into bonds that were sold in 2006 and 2007. Mr. Schneiderman resigned last month after allegations that he had physically assaulted several women he had dated. The lawsuits that he brought against Wall Street firms for selling faulty mortgage bonds were among the highlights of his tenure.The ruling does not mean the end of the lawsuit against Credit Suisse. The court said some of the claims may be able to proceed under another statute, the Executive Law. The Court of Appeals sent the case back to the trial court to analyze whether the claims are still viable under that statute.But Credit Suisse was quick to claim victory. ‚Limiting the statute of limitations period for Martin Act claims is significant not only for this case but for all future industry proceedings,‚ the bank said in a statement.The bank said it would continue to defend itself against remaining Executive Law claims.",New York‚Äôs Top Court Limits Time Frame for Martin Act Lawsuits,"June 12, 2018 /  2:53 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-new-york/new-york-top-court-narrows-martin-act-in-11-billion-credit-suisse-case-idUSKBN1J81WK,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York’s highest court on Tuesday curbed the state attorney general’s ability to fight fraud on Wall Street, awarding a victory to Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) as it tries to end an $11 billion lawsuit over risky mortgage securities. FILE PHOTO - A Credit Suisse sign is seen on the exterior of their Americas headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, September 1, 2015.  REUTERS/Mike SegarBy a 4-1 vote, the state Court of Appeals said New York’s top law enforcement officer has just three years to bring claims under the Martin Act, a 1921 law granting that office broad power to pursue civil and criminal cases over securities fraud without having to prove intent to defraud. Two lower courts had agreed with the attorney general that the deadline should be six years, and rejected Credit Suisse’s arguments that the state sued too late. Tuesday’s decision overturned those findings. “The Martin Act imposes numerous obligations - or ‘liabilities’ - that did not exist at common law, justifying the imposition of a three-year statute of limitations,” Chief Judge Janet DiFiore wrote. The decision could doom a November 2012 lawsuit brought by then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accusing Credit Suisse of lying about the quality of loans underlying residential mortgage-backed securities it sold in 2006 and 2007, resulting in steep investor losses during the global financial crisis. But the appeals court said current Attorney General Barbara Underwood deserved a chance to show a lower court that Credit Suisse committed fraud under common law, subjecting it to a six-year statute of limitations under the state’s Executive Law. Underwood took over the case after Schneiderman resigned last month. “We don’t anticipate this impacting our cases in any significant way,” said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Underwood. “This decision will have no impact on our efforts to vigorously pursue financial fraud wherever it exists in New York. That includes continuing our case against Credit Suisse.” The lawsuit had accused Credit Suisse of concealing known defects in home loans underlying its securities in a bid to sell more securities and generate higher fees. “This will significantly constrain the NY AG’s reach,” John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia Law School, said in an email. “Yes, the AG can sue on a common law fraud theory and have six years, but then it must prove much more, including an intent to defraud.” Coffee noted that the three-year deadline is shorter than the five years that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has to pursue securities fraud claims. Credit Suisse spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said the Swiss bank was “extremely pleased” to defeat the Martin Act claim, and that the three-year statute of limitations was significant “for all future industry proceedings.” The bank will keep defending itself against the attorney general’s “unfounded and meritless allegations,” she said. Judge Jenny Rivera dissented from Tuesday’s decision. She  called on New York’s legislature to restore the six-year statute of limitations “before significant damage is done to the state’s securities markets.” The Martin Act gained new life under former Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who invoked it in 2005 when he sued American International Group Inc’s (AIG.N) longtime chairman Maurice “Hank” Greenberg over two alleged sham reinsurance transactions. Schneiderman also invoked it when he began probing whether Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) misled the public about climate change.

In the future, Mr. Navarro said, he will stick to discussing serious policy issues and differences.‚If you make a mistake, you should admit it, learn from it, don‚t repeat it,‚ Mr. Navarro said.Asked if he was apologizing, Mr. Navarro said, ‚yeah, absolutely.‚ His earlier comments had followed Mr. Trump‚s own sharp words for Mr. Trudeau, whom the president called ‚dishonest and weak‚ and accused of making ‚false statements.‚Mr. Trump was angered by Mr. Trudeau‚s remarks at the end of the Group of 7 gathering on Saturday that Canada would not be bullied by the United States; the president lashed back in a series of tweets aboard Air Force One as he headed to Singapore for a summit meeting with Kim Jong-un.On Sunday, Mr. Navarro, who is Mr. Trump‚s most hawkish trade adviser, assailed Mr. Trudeau for engaging in ‚bad faith diplomacy‚ in the wake of the G-7 meeting.‚There‚s a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door,‚ Mr. Navarro said on ‚Fox News Sunday.‚‚And that‚s what bad faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference,‚ Mr. Navarro said.While Mr. Navarro backed down from his attack, Mr. Trump did not, continuing on Tuesday to accuse Mr. Trudeau of acting in bad faith and trying to take advantage of the United States. At a news conference in Singapore, the president said Mr. Trudeau only made his comments about not being bullied because he thought Mr. Trump was on an airplane and would not hear about them.‚Justin probably didn‚t know that Air Force One has about 20 televisions, and I see the television,‚ Mr. Trump said. ‚And he‚s giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. And I say, push him around? We just shook hands. It was very friendly.‚Mr. Trump, who has since threatened to impose tariffs on Canada, added: ‚He learned. That‚s going to cost a lot of money for the people of Canada. He learned. You can‚t do that. You can‚t do that.‚Mr. Navarro was not the only White House adviser to hit the airwaves on Sunday with a tough message about Mr. Trudeau.Larry Kudlow, the head of Mr. Trump‚s National Economic Council, also called Mr. Trudeau‚s behavior a ‚stunt‚ and a ‚betrayal‚ while speaking on CNN on Sunday. He suggested that Mr. Trump was trying to project strength ahead of his summit with the North Korean leader.Mr. Navarro‚s remarks strained the already tense negotiations between the United States and Canada.

At an event hosted by the Journal, Navarro said he had made a mistake, according to the newspaper. “My mission was to send a strong signal of strength,”  Navarro said at the event, according to the Journal. “The problem is that in conveying that message I used language that was inappropriate.” The admission was a rare act of contrition from U.S. President Donald Trump’s White House, where public apologies are few.  Canada reacted coolly to the apology, with Trudeau declining to answer when reporters asked him whether he accepted it. “We will continue to conduct our diplomacy the Canadian way, that is, being positive and constructive and firm in defending the interests of our industries ... in diplomacy it doesn’t really matter about personal feelings and personal comments,” said Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne when asked about the apology. Navarro condemned Trudeau following the Canadian leader’s news conference after his summit meeting with Trump and other world leaders from the Group of Seven. Related CoverageCanada's Freeland says prepared for drama in U.S. trade talks“There is a special place in hell for any leader that engages in bad-faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door and that’s what bad-faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference. That’s what weak, dishonest Justin Trudeau did,” Navarro said on the “Fox News Sunday” program. A day before, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow had also lashed out at Trudeau. Both aides accused Trudeau of betraying Trump, a Republican, at a news conference held after the U.S. president had departed Canada. That was when Trudeau said Canada would take retaliatory steps in response to steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by Trump on Canada and other allies. Before the apology, some U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday questioned the strong language the White House and Trump have used toward Canada in contrast to the praise he gave North Korea at Tuesday’s summit in Singapore.  Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations, told MSNBC Trump had welcomed authoritarian leaders in other countries even as he “picks fights as he just did at the G7 with our longest, oldest closest allies: democracies, developed Western countries like Canada.” FILE PHOTO: Robert Lighthizer, United States Trade Representative, and Peter Navarro chat while they wait for U.S. President Donald Trump to arrive to make an announcement about new tariffs for steel and aluminum imports at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 8, 2018.

Col. Jennifer Lovett, a United States military spokeswoman in South Korea, said in an email that the American command there ‚has received no updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises ‚ to include this fall‚s schedule Ulchi Freedom Guardian.‚‚We will continue with our current military posture until we receive updated guidance from the Department of Defense,‚ she added. In Washington, officials at the Pentagon, State Department and White House were scrambling to figure out exactly the impact of Mr. Trump‚s comments.‚The Department of Defense continues to work with the White House, the interagency, and our allies and partners on the way forward,‚ Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said in an email. ‚We will provide additional information as it becomes available.‚In Seoul, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea hailed Mr. Trump‚s summit meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Mr. Moon called the joint statement that was released after the meeting ‚a historic event that has helped break down the last remaining Cold War legacy on earth.‚But Mr. Trump‚s promise to end joint military exercises with Seoul left many South Koreans stunned. The annual exercises have been an integral part of the alliance, forming the bulwark of South Korea‚s defense against North Korea and Seoul‚s sense of security among bigger powers in the region.Ulchi Freedom Guardian is one of the largest military exercises in the world. The war games, which last year ran for 11 days, have involved some 17,500 American forces, including about 3,000 from outside the peninsula, and 50,000 South Korean troops. The exercises include computer simulations carried out in a large bunker south of Seoul intended to check the allies‚ readiness to repel aggressions by North Korea. Mr. Trump‚s announcement raised fears in the South Korean capital that Washington was making concessions too fast, before North Korea has dismantled its nuclear weapons.The South Korean Defense Ministry hurriedly issued a curt statement saying that it was trying to figure out Mr. Trump‚s intentions.American officials said the military exercises are important because the allies use them to ensure readiness and promote the ability to operate with similar equipment and tactics. On a strategic level, they demonstrate the strength of the decades-long alliance with South Korea. ‚On the face of it, seems like a pretty big concession,‚ said Brian McKeon, who was a senior Pentagon official during the Obama administration.Mr. McKeon added that it was unclear whether Mr. Trump‚s order applies only to major war games like Ulchi Freedom Guardian, or a series of other smaller, but important, training maneuvers. ‚It would definitely impact readiness‚ of both American and South Korean forces, he said.The president‚s statement also confused officials in Washington. While ‚war games‚ would be canceled, Vice President Mike Pence assured Republican senators that routine military exercises involving American and South Korean troops would continue, said Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado. ‚@VP was very clear: regular readiness training and training exchanges will continue,‚ Mr. Gardner said in a Twitter post.In a Tuesday news conference in Singapore, before heading back to Washington, Mr. Trump focused on the potential cost savings of ending major exercises, which he said were ‚tremendously expensive‚ to conduct.‚We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money,‚ the president said, also criticizing South Korea for not defraying more of the costs. ‚We have to talk to them. We have to talk to many countries about treating us fairly.‚Mr. Trump singled out long-range bombers, like B-52s and B-1s, that routinely fly in exercises near the Korean Peninsula.‚We fly in bombers from Guam,‚ Mr. Trump said. ‚I said it when I first started, I said, ‚Where do the bombers come from? Guam. Nearby.‚ I said ‚Oh great, nearby, where is nearby?‚ Six and a half hours. Six and a half hours. That‚s a long time for these big massive planes to be flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place and then go back to Guam.‚‚I know a lot about airplanes,‚ Mr. Trump added. ‚It‚s very expensive. I didn‚t like it. What I did say is and I think it is very provocative.‚Kathleen Hicks, another former senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration, said that Mr. Trump‚s cost argument was misleading since any savings would likely decrease combat readiness. ‚It is true that if you don‚t choose to ready your force, you can cut costs,‚ she said on Tuesday. ‚But the administration should be acknowledging that it is in fact a readiness decrement.‚Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican of South Carolina who speaks to Mr. Trump regularly, played down the impact of halting any exercises. But he strongly cautioned against another proposal Mr. Trump has been weighing: reducing the 28,500 American troops now stationed on the Korean Peninsula.‚I don‚t think canceling a war game is going to matter over the arc of time,‚ Mr. Graham said on NBC‚s ‚Today‚ program.‚The one thing that I would violently disagree with is removing our troops,‚ he said. ‚I can‚t imagine I would vote for any agreement that requires us to withdraw our forces because that would destabilize Asia. That‚s what China wants. That doesn‚t make the world more peaceful, it makes it more dangerous.‚",Pentagon and Seoul Surprised by Trump Pledge to Halt Military Exercises,"June 12, 2018 /  10:12 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-military/trump-surprises-with-pledge-to-end-military-exercises-in-south-korea-idUSKBN1J812W,"SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s declaration on Tuesday that he intended to end joint military exercises with South Korea took South Korean and U.S. military officials by surprise. Although the Pentagon said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was consulted ahead of time, current and former U.S. defense officials expressed concern at the possibility that the United States would unilaterally halt military exercises without an explicit concession from North Korea lowering the threat from Pyongyang. “I’m sort of stunned about how much we gave up and how little we got in return,” said one former official, saying the decision “borders on irresponsible” and would erode readiness and diminish the credibility of the U.S.-South Korean alliance. Trump made the remarks at a news conference after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, calling war games expensive and “provocative” - echoing a North Korean criticism that the United States had long rejected. Trump also said he wants “at some point” to withdraw the American troops currently in South Korea. “We have right now 32,000 soldiers in South Korea, and I’d like to be able to bring them back home. But that’s not part of the equation right now,” Trump said. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean War, which ended in 1953 in an armistice that left the two Koreas technically still at war. If implemented, the end of military exercises could be one of the most concrete and controversial moves to arise from Trump’s summit with Kim, who pledged to pursue denuclearization but offered no details.  South Korea’s Presidential Blue House said it needed to “to find out the precise meaning or intentions” of Trump’s statement, while adding that it was willing to “explore various measures to help the talks move forward more smoothly.” A spokeswoman for U.S. military forces in Korea said they had not received any direction to cease joint military drills. The move could diminish the U.S. military’s ability to “fight tonight,” a term American commanders have used for years to describe the heightened posture of U.S. forces in one of the world’s most-sensitive military flashpoints. Even during budget cuts under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama that eroded readiness elsewhere in the world, the Pentagon prioritized exercises on the Korean peninsula that included everything from air combat to infantry drills. The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every year with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month. Max Thunder’s air combat exercises so unnerved North Korea that it issued threatening statements that nearly scuttled the summit. Foal Eagle is designed to simulate war scenarios and involves ground, air, naval and special operations forces. Asked about the plan to halt exercises, a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity shrugged and called it a political, not military, decision.

Picture taken on April 9, 2017.  Courtesy Joshua Fulton/U.S. Navy/Handout via REUTERS  The Pentagon declined to flesh out Trump’s remarks about suspending drills, a move the U.S. military had long resisted, saying it was working with the White House, U.S. allies and partners “on the way forward following the summit.” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White denied that Mattis was caught off guard by the announcement, telling Pentagon reporters: “There were no surprises.” In a separate statement, White said Mattis was “fully aligned” with Trump. ‘I WAS SHOCKED’ A South Korean official said he initially thought Trump had misspoken. “I was shocked when he called the exercises ‘provocative,’ a very unlikely word to be used by a U.S. president,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. South Korean President Moon Jae-in spoke by phone with Trump for 20 minutes late on Tuesday, but an official readout of the call made no mention of military exercises. South Korea said last month the issue of U.S. troops stationed there was unrelated to any future peace treaty with North Korea and that American forces should stay even if such an agreement were signed. China, historically North Korea’s closest partner, has also sought a “freeze for freeze” agreement in which the exercises would be suspended in exchange for North Korea’s stopping its weapons development. The United States had rejected such proposals in the past, but North Korea has unilaterally declared an end to testing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and now Trump appears ready to end exercises while talks are ongoing. Given Kim only repeated vague commitments to pursue the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” some experts questioned whether Trump was making excessive concessions. “I hope - but am not yet confident - that (North Korea) will take steps that match the concessions Mr. Trump has already made by ending military exercises in South Korea and granting Mr. Kim legitimacy with this summit,” Thomas Countryman, a top arms control official under President Barack Obama, told Reuters. Mitchell Reiss, who served from 2003-2005 as the U.S. State Department’s director of policy planning, said it is important to make such decisions hand-in-hand with South Korea.

REUTERS/Enrique Calvo/File PhotoInaki Urdangarin signed himself into the Brieva prison in Avila at around 8:00 am (0600 GMT). He had been given a five-day deadline last Tuesday to appear at a penal institution of his choosing for the five-year 10-month sentence. The 162-cell mostly-woman’s prison has a small separate area for men and was chosen for its proximity to Madrid to ease visits by his wife, Princess Cristina who is the sister of King Felipe VI, newspaper El Pais reported. Urdangarin was found guilty in February last year of using royal connections to win public contracts to put on events through his non-profit organization, the Noos Foundation. He then overcharged for the events and hid millions of euros in proceeds abroad. Princess Cristina, who lives in Geneva with their four children, was acquitted of being an accessory to tax fraud  after a year-long trial of 18 defendants in the probe of the charity run by her husband.  Cristina was the first member of the Spanish royal family ever to stand in a dock. Some of the foundation’s money was shown to be transferred to a private company and used to pay for family holidays, home furnishings and theater tickets. Public support for the Spanish royal family waned during the around five-year economic slump but it slumped after it emerged that then-King Juan Carlos had gone on an elephant-hunting expedition in Botswana at the height of the crisis.  Juan Carlos, 80, abdicated in 2014 in favor of his son Felipe, 50.     When he ascended the throne and as part of efforts to modernize the monarchy, King Felipe removed his elder sisters, Elena and Cristina, from royal duties. The following year he stripped Cristina of her title of Duchess of Palma. Urdangarin, a retired Spanish handball player, appealed the sentence before the Supreme Court, which cut the sentence slightly after overturning a part of the original ruling by the Mallorcan Court.

On Tuesday, the senior public prosecutor Christina Voigt charged Mr. Arnault with two counts of rape, both involving the same woman, in relation to episodes in 2011.‚I think my evidence is so good that I have to indict him,‚ Ms. Voigt said.Mr. Arnault‚s lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, but he has previously denied the allegations against his client and described them as a public ‚witch hunt.‚Prosecutors charged Mr. Arnault with assaulting a woman in October 2011, forcing her to perform oral sex and have intercourse.‚He forced her by grabbing her and holding her very firm on her neck so she couldn‚t get away,‚ Ms. Voigt said.In December 2011, prosecutors said, he raped the same woman while she slept.‚When you‚re asleep you are in a helpless state,‚ Ms. Voigt said. ‚You don‚t have the ability to defend yourself.‚ The scandal erupted in November, when the newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported on accusations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Arnault by 18 women, over three decades, putting him and the Swedish Academy at the heart of Sweden‚s most prominent #MeToo episode yet.One woman, Anna-Karin Bylund, a textile artist, said she had written to the academy in 1996, warning of misconduct by Mr. Arnault, but her complaint was ignored.As a result of the revelations, the academy cut its ties with Forum, Mr. Arnault‚s cultural club, and the police opened a criminal investigation. The academy refused to expel Mr. Arnault‚s wife, Katarina Frostenson, a well-known poet; instead, members who wanted to play down the scandal ousted Sara Danius, the first woman to lead the academy, from her post.Several academy members resigned in protest. The panel announced last month that as it tried to get its house in order, it would not award a literature prize in 2018 ‚ the first time in 69 years that a year had been skipped.‚Perhaps justice will finally be served,‚ Per Wastberg, a member of the academy, said on Tuesday, in response to the indictment. ‚I have believed these 18 women, and have since then heard many more scary witness testimonies.‚Bjorn Wiman, culture editor at Dagens Nyheter, called the indictment a vindication for the women who came forward in November.‚Very few of them have found it worthwhile to file police reports ‚ out of shame, out of fear that he will destroy their careers,‚ he said. ‚It is about a society‚s disability to handle these kinds of allegations historically, and this is what this new #MeToo movement was about. It empowered women to come forward to deal with these kinds of harassments that they have been subjected to through the years.‚The Swedish Academy‚s decision to delay the Nobel Prize represented an extraordinary reckoning for an institution that has long been admired as one of the world‚s most prestigious scholarly bodies, but also criticized as secretive and patriarchal.The academy could decide in 2019 to award two prizes, one for this year and one for next year ‚ the approach it took in 1950, after skipping 1949. But last month, Lars Heikensten, director of the Nobel Foundation, said in a radio interview there might not be a literature prize next year, either.Mr. Heikensten told the public service broadcaster Sveriges Radio that the prize would ‚be awarded when the Swedish Academy has won back the public‚s trust.‚",Rape Charges Filed in Scandal Tied to Nobel Literature Prize,"June 12, 2018 /  12:22 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nobel-prize-charges/man-at-center-of-nobel-literature-scandal-charged-with-rape-idUSKBN1J81HH,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Swedish state prosecutor has brought two charges of rape against the man at the center of a scandal that forced the Swedish Academy to cancel the award of the Nobel Prize for literature in 2018, the prosecutor said on Tuesday. Late last year, 18 women accused photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, who is married to a member of the Academy, of sexual harassment and assault, leading to a preliminary investigation by state prosecutors. District prosecutor Christina Voigt said on Tuesday that Arnault had been charged with two counts of rape against a woman in Stockholm in 2011. “My view is that the evidence is solid and sufficient for charges to be brought,” Voigt said in a statement. Arnault denies the allegations, as well as separate allegations that he was responsible for leaking the names of some prize-winners ahead of the official announcement. “He maintains that he is completely innocent of the allegations,” Bjorn Hurtig, Arnault’s lawyer, told Reuters on Tuesday. “I do not share the prosecutor’s view that the evidence is robust. Accounts differ, there is no technical evidence, there are no direct witness accounts and the events are a long time in the past.” Prosecutors closed another preliminary investigation into a number of the abuse allegations against Arnault in March, citing insufficient evidence and because for some the statute of limitations had expired.  Several members of the Academy have resigned over how the institution, one of Sweden’s most prestigious, handled its own investigation into the allegations against Arnault. Arcane rules meant that they could not be replaced and in May the committee said it would not hand out the Nobel Prize for Literature this year as it needed time to restore public trust.

A chorus of antitrust experts has already been calling for a fundamental rethinking of the prevailing laissez-faire approach to vertical mergers, and Judge Leon‚s ruling is likely to amplify their critique. (The government will probably appeal the decision. The case theoretically could reach the Supreme Court, which has not considered a vertical merger since 1972.)In allowing the merger, Judge Leon in many ways took the path of least resistance. However persuasive its arguments, the Justice Department, which sued to prevent the deal, could not cite a single recent precedent for blocking it.[Read full coverage of Judge Leon‚s decision to allow the AT&T-Time Warner deal to continue.]The last time the government brought such a case was in 1979. The Federal Trade Commission challenged the merger of Fruehauf, then the country‚s largest manufacturer of truck trailers, and Kelsey-Hayes, which made truck components like heavy-duty wheels and antiskid brakes. The government lost.Credit for the lack of such cases goes largely to Robert H. Bork.Mr. Bork is best known as the solicitor general who fired the Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox and as a doomed Supreme Court nominee, not as an antitrust trailblazer.But in 1978, a year before the Fruehauf case, Mr. Bork, at the time a Yale law professor, published ‚The Antitrust Paradox.‚ The book argued that the main purpose of antitrust law was to protect consumers by encouraging economic efficiencies and that authorities, therefore, should not focus on blocking vertical deals. The argument had a profound and immediate impact on antitrust analysis and has been cited by numerous courts, including the Supreme Court. The Clayton Antitrust Act, which dates to 1914, bans mergers that may ‚substantially lessen‚ competition or ‚tend to create a monopoly.‚ It makes no distinction between vertical mergers and horizontal ones, in which a company buys a rival, thereby reducing the number of competitors in an industry. But in large part thanks to Mr. Bork‚s analysis, horizontal mergers continue to receive intense scrutiny from the federal government, while most vertical mergers go forward, albeit often with conditions.From the publication of ‚The Antitrust Paradox‚ through 2016, the government has challenged only 52 of the thousands of vertical mergers, and many of those challenges were focused on horizontal aspects of the deals. None of those cases went to trial. Most were resolved through consent decrees, including Comcast‚s 2009 bid for NBCUniversal, which went forward after Comcast and the government agreed to a long list of restrictions on the combined company‚s behavior.The Justice Department last rewrote its vertical merger guidelines in 1984. (The horizontal guidelines have been revised three times since then.)

The theory is that vertical mergers produce efficiencies that can be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, higher quality or both.Not surprisingly, AT&T argued in court that it had no incentive to withhold Time Warner‚s programming from other distributors, that consumers would derive many benefits from the merger and that the combined companies would be in a better position to compete with upstarts like Amazon and Netflix, which already are vertically integrated. This analysis may still hold true for mergers of essentially fungible components, like the truck beds and brakes at issue in the Fruehauf case.But it‚s not clear that logic holds in a case like AT&T‚s merger with Time Warner. Not only does AT&T occupy a dominant position in a highly concentrated telecommunications market, but Time Warner product‚s ‚ like HBO‚s ‚Game of Thrones‚ and CNN ‚ aren‚t at all fungible. If AT&T wants to withhold ‚must have‚ programming from a rival telecom company, or charge more for it, that company cannot readily replace it. That was the crux of the government‚s case ‚ that vertical mergers, at least in this context, can reduce competition and harm consumers.‚The big question was whether Judge Leon would accept where academics and economists have gone with this, or whether he‚d stick with the old approach,‚ said Mr. Wu, the Columbia law professor, who is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.Judge Leon, who stressed that his decision should not be taken as a broad precedent, went with the old approach.Although Mr. Bork‚s fingerprints are all over the opinion, Judge Leon departed from Mr. Bork‚s doctrine by acknowledging that vertical mergers ‚are not invariably innocuous.‚But the emergence of competitors like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu loomed large in his analysis. ‚I simply cannot evaluate the government‚s theories,‚ he wrote in his opinion, without considering ‚the dramatic changes that are transforming how consumers are viewing video content.‚[Focus is on Comcast and 21st Century Fox now that the AT&T-Time Warner deal has been approved.]No matter the outcome if the decision is appealed, the Justice Department ‚is going to have to update the vertical merger guidelines,‚ said Steven C.

The ruling by Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia brings an end to a six-week antitrust trial in which U.S. regulators argued that the $85 billion deal would give AT&T undue leverage against rival cable providers that relied on Time Warner’s content. The judge’s strong approval, and scathing opinion that urged the government not to seek a stay if they opposed the ruling, will give telecommunications providers the confidence that similar types of acquisitions will also have a shot at clearing regulatory hurdles, and could spur other copycat mergers this year, industry analysts and dealmakers said.  Investors are now also expecting major media consolidation, with Twenty-First Century Fox Inc shares rising more than 6 percent in after-market trading. Cable network owner Discovery Inc saw shares increase 3.2 percent while mobile providers, Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O), which are waiting for a government approval of their own, also saw a bump following the decision. AT&T said that controlling Time Warner’s cable brands will help it craft new types of content to retain its customers as web-based rivals like Netflix Inc woo audiences away from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.  For cable companies feeling the pain of cord-cutting, similar deals for coveted media brands could help them build out new content offerings and offset expected declines in revenues, analysts and dealmakers told Reuters.  The Justice Department had argued that AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner would allow it to charge premium prices to rivals who relied on its Turner and HBO channels to woo customers to their cable plans, potentially giving it an unfair advantage in the pay-TV market. Now this will be a less of a concern for companies.  “This decision could serve as a ‘green light’ for other potential M&A, including Comcast’s ongoing pursuit of FOX,” said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS, in a note.  Regulators will still likely scrutinize similar deals, and there is no guarantee that the district court’s approval of AT&T’s merger with Time Warner means that other major media acquisitions would be approved, several antitrust attorneys told Reuters.  Still, at least one company, Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, had been waiting for the court decision before making any large M&A moves in media, sources have said. Rival cable company Comcast is now likely to go ahead with its planned attempt to woo Fox away from Walt Disney Co, which said it would acquire most assets of the media company for around $50 billion last year.  “Regardless of what happens on the appeal front, expect Comcast to put forth an all-cash bid in the next day or so at a premium to Disney,” said Mary Ann Halford, senior adviser to OC&C Strategy Consultants. Comcast is aiming to gain control over Fox assets such as its Twentieth Century Fox Film and TV studios, which includes brands ranging from X-Men to The Simpsons, as well many of its cable networks. The court ruling could also open the door for Verizon, AT&T’S main rival, to bid for a media company, UBS’ Hodulik added.  However, in Verizon’s most recent quarterly earnings call, executives said they would rather sit out the current consolidation, and instead build out its content offerings through partnerships with independent media companies.  It also appointed a new chief executive officer earlier this month, Hans Vestberg, the company’s chief technology officer, in a move that signaled Verizon would likely double down on its existing telecommunications business. Still, one potential target for Verizon would be a combined CBS Corp and Viacom Inc, analysts have said, assuming that on ongoing legal battle between CBS’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and the company’s board, is resolved. In a recent court filing, Redstone said her long-term plan was to create a combined company, which would unite media assets including CBS’ broadcast networks, Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, and then sell it.

Opportunity is at historically low energy levels. The rover weathered another serious storm in 2007, but the current storm is much worse, having intensified more rapidly and more completely blocking out the sun, NASA said. ‚It is unprecedented in the pace at which it has grown and spread across the globe,‚ said Jim Watzin, the director of NASA‚s Mars exploration program.The storm, first spotted on May 30, is now among the most intense ever observed on Mars. It covers an area nearly the size of North America and South America combined and could encircle the planet within a matter of days, as the storm in 2007 and another in 2001 did, officials said.In its low-power mode, the rover has shut down many of its functions. A mission clock remains running to periodically wake an onboard computer to check power levels before going to sleep again. But even in that mode, the rover must balance battery conservation against subfreezing temperatures. The heaters it uses to survive Mars‚s extreme cold draw power from the battery, but NASA officials were optimistic about Opportunity‚s prospects because the planet entered spring last month and dust storms can keep temperatures high (by Martian standards).‚As long as the rover stays warm enough, and our predictions are that it will, we can go any number of days,‚ Mr. Callas said. ‚We are approaching summer, so we haven‚t even hit the warmest part of the year for the rover at this site.‚ Because of the amount of dust swirling over the valley where Opportunity lies, it isn‚t clear how long the rover will have to wait to receive enough sunlight to recharge. Debris could also settle on its panels, obscuring the light, but winds have helped avert that fate in the past, officials said.Opportunity was one of a pair of rovers that landed on Mars in 2004 and proceeded to make important discoveries about the water in the planet‚s past.Opportunity, for example, found evidence that at least one part of Mars had stayed wet long enough to sustain microbial life. The other rover, Spirit, found that the planet was once far wetter than it is today.Both long outlived their 90-day missions, with NASA abandoning Spirit in 2011, two years after it got stuck in a sand trap.

John Callas, Opportunity project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said the solar-powered rover, with the sun blotted out by an intensifying dust storm already engulfing a quarter of Mars, is no longer responding to commands. The six-wheeled robotic explorer relies upon electricity that its solar panels generate from sunlight. “The project team is very concerned,” Callas told reporters, adding that a “spacecraft emergency” has been declared.

Cold, desolate Mars, with its thin atmosphere and desert conditions, is prone to dust storms that can last months. Opportunity weathered a planet-wide storm in 2007.

When the skies clear and the rover begins to power up, it should begin to communicate with us,” Callas said, expressing confidence that Opportunity will not be buried in dust. NASA engineers received a transmission from Opportunity on Sunday but no response when they attempted to contact it since. Another NASA rover called Curiosity, which arrived on Mars in 2012, does not face the same level of threat from the storm, which was detected on May 30. Opportunity’s scientific findings include evidence that Mars may have had conditions favorable for sustaining microbial life. Opportunity has been examining whether the Perseverance Valley geological feature was carved out by flowing water, wind erosion or both. Opportunity and its twin rover, Spirit, which arrived the same month, both carrying a suite of scientific instruments to study the terrain, operated on opposite sides of the planet. Spirit ceased communications in 2010 after becoming stuck in sand.

Opportunity is at historically low energy levels. The rover weathered another serious storm in 2007, but the current storm is much worse, having intensified more rapidly and more completely blocking out the sun, NASA said. ‚It is unprecedented in the pace at which it has grown and spread across the globe,‚ said Jim Watzin, the director of NASA‚s Mars exploration program.The storm, first spotted on May 30, is now among the most intense ever observed on Mars. It covers an area nearly the size of North America and South America combined and could encircle the planet within a matter of days, as the storm in 2007 and another in 2001 did, officials said.In its low-power mode, the rover has shut down many of its functions. A mission clock remains running to periodically wake an onboard computer to check power levels before going to sleep again. But even in that mode, the rover must balance battery conservation against subfreezing temperatures. The heaters it uses to survive Mars‚s extreme cold draw power from the battery, but NASA officials were optimistic about Opportunity‚s prospects because the planet entered spring last month and dust storms can keep temperatures high (by Martian standards).‚As long as the rover stays warm enough, and our predictions are that it will, we can go any number of days,‚ Mr. Callas said. ‚We are approaching summer, so we haven‚t even hit the warmest part of the year for the rover at this site.‚ Because of the amount of dust swirling over the valley where Opportunity lies, it isn‚t clear how long the rover will have to wait to receive enough sunlight to recharge. Debris could also settle on its panels, obscuring the light, but winds have helped avert that fate in the past, officials said.Opportunity was one of a pair of rovers that landed on Mars in 2004 and proceeded to make important discoveries about the water in the planet‚s past.Opportunity, for example, found evidence that at least one part of Mars had stayed wet long enough to sustain microbial life. The other rover, Spirit, found that the planet was once far wetter than it is today.Both long outlived their 90-day missions, with NASA abandoning Spirit in 2011, two years after it got stuck in a sand trap. While members of the NASA team working on Opportunity are optimistic about its chances, they‚ve grown attached and can‚t help worrying, Mr. Callas said.‚It‚s like you have a loved one in a coma at the hospital,‚ he said. ‚The doctors are telling you that you just have to give it time and she‚ll wake up.

But National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists emphasized there could be nonbiological explanations for both discoveries made by the Curiosity rover at a site called Gale crater, leaving the issue of Martian life a tantalizing but unanswered question. Three different types of organic molecules were discovered when the rover dug just 2 inches (5 cm) into roughly 3.5 billion-year-old mudstone, a fine-grained sedimentary rock, at Gale crater, apparently the site of a large lake when ancient Mars was warmer and wetter than the desolate planet it is today.   Curiosity also measured an unexpectedly large seasonal cycle in the low levels of atmospheric methane. About 95 percent of the methane in Earth’s atmosphere is produced from biological activity, though the scientists said it is too soon to know if the Martian methane also is related to life. Organic molecules are the building blocks of life, though they can also be produced by chemical reactions unrelated to life. The scientists said it is premature to know whether or not the compounds were created in biological processes. Whether anywhere other than Earth has harbored life, perhaps even in microbial form, is one of the paramount questions in science.  “There’s three possible sources for the organic material,” said astrobiologist Jennifer Eigenbrode of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. “The first one would be life, which we don’t know about. The second would be meteorites. And the last one is geological processes, meaning the rock-forming processes themselves.” The rover, which has allowed scientists to explore whether Mars ever boasted conditions conducive to life, in 2014 made the first definitive detection of organic molecules, also in Gale crater rock formed from ancient lake sediment - but it was a much more limited set of compounds.

Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/Handout via REUTERS “What the organic detections in the rock do is to add to the story of habitability. It tells us that this ancient environment on Mars could have supported life,” Eigenbrode said. “Everything that was needed to support life was there. But it doesn’t tell us that life was there.” Christopher Webster, an atmospheric science research fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said it is possible existing microbes are contributing to the Martian atmospheric methane. “With this new data, we again cannot rule out microbial activity as a potential source,” Webster said. The amount of methane peaked at the end of summer in the northern hemisphere at about 2.7 times the level of the lowest seasonal amount. The scientists were surprised to find organic compounds, especially in the amounts detected, considering the harsh conditions, including bombardment of solar radiation on the Martian surface. After drilling, Curiosity heats the rock samples, releasing the compounds. Referring to the findings regarding organic compounds and methane, Webster said, “They hint at an earlier time on Mars when water was present and the existence of primitive life forms was possible.” Slideshow (7 Images)The scientists hope to find better preserved organic compounds with Curiosity or other rovers that would allow them to check for chemical signatures of life.

24973816,3231,['2018-06-13t21:00:09.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/technology/apple-iphone-police.html,"SAN FRANCISCO ‚ Apple has long positioned the iPhone as a secure device that only its owner can open. That has led to battles with law enforcement officials who want to get information off them, including a well-publicized showdown with the F.B.I. in 2016 after Apple refused to help open the locked iPhone of a mass killer.The F.B.I. eventually paid a third party to get into the phone, circumventing the need for Apple‚s help. Since then, law enforcement agencies across the country have increasingly employed that strategy to get into locked iPhones they hope will hold the key to cracking cases.Now Apple is closing the technological loophole that let authorities hack into iPhones, angering police and other officials and reigniting a debate over whether the government has a right to get into the personal devices that are at the center of modern life.Apple said it was planning an iPhone software update that would effectively disable the phone‚s charging and data port ‚ the opening where users plug in headphones, power cables and adapters ‚ an hour after the phone is locked. While a phone can still be charged, a person would first need to enter the phone‚s password to transfer data to or from the device using the port. Such a change would hinder law enforcement officials, who have typically been opening locked iPhones by connecting another device running special software to the port, often days or even months after the smartphone was last unlocked. News of Apple‚s planned software update has begun spreading through security blogs and law enforcement circles ‚ and many in investigative agencies are infuriated.‚If we go back to the situation where we again don‚t have access, now we know directly all the evidence we‚ve lost and all the kids we can‚t put into a position of safety,‚ said Chuck Cohen, who leads an Indiana State Police task force on internet crimes against children. The Indiana State Police said it unlocked 96 iPhones for various cases this year, each time with a warrant, using a $15,000 device it bought in March from a company called Grayshift.But privacy advocates said Apple would be right to fix a security flaw that has become easier and cheaper to exploit. ‚This is a really big vulnerability in Apple‚s phones,‚ said Matthew D. Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University. A Grayshift device sitting on a desk at a police station, he said, ‚could very easily leak out into the world.‚In an email, an Apple spokesman, Fred Sainz, said the company is constantly strengthening security protections and fixes any vulnerability it finds in its phones, partly because criminals could also exploit the same flaws that law enforcement agencies use. ‚We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don‚t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs,‚ he said.Apple and Google, which make the software in nearly all of the world‚s smartphones, began encrypting their mobile software by default in 2014. Encryption scrambles data to make it unreadable until accessed with a special key, often a password. That frustrated police and prosecutors who could not pull data from smartphones, even with a warrant. The friction came into public view after the F.B.I. could not access the iPhone of a gunman who, along with his wife, killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in late 2015. A federal judge ordered Apple to figure out how to open the phone, prompting Timothy D. Cook, Apple‚s chief executive, to respond with a blistering 1,100-word letter that said the company refused to compromise its users‚ privacy. ‚The implications of the government‚s demands are chilling,‚ he wrote.The two sides fought in court for a month. Then the F.B.I. abruptly announced that it had found an undisclosed group to get into the phone, paying at least $1.3 million because the hacking techniques were not common then. An inspector general‚s report this year suggested the F.B.I. should have exhausted more options before it took Apple to court.Since then, two main companies have helped law enforcement hack into iPhones: Cellebrite, an Israeli forensics firm purchased by Japan‚s Sun Corporation in 2006, and Grayshift, which was founded by a former Apple engineer in 2016. Law enforcement officials said they generally send iPhones to Cellebrite to unlock, with each phone costing several thousand dollars to open. In March, Grayshift began selling a $15,000 GrayKey device that the police can use to unlock iPhones themselves.Apple has closed loopholes in the past. For years, the police used software to break into phones by simply trying every possible passcode. Apple blocked that technique in 2010 by disabling iPhones after a certain number of incorrect attempts. But the Grayshift and Cellebrite software appear to be able to disable that Apple technology, allowing their devices to test thousands of passcodes, Mr. Green said.Cellebrite declined to comment. Grayshift did not respond to requests for comment.Opening locked iPhones through these methods has become more common, law enforcement officials said. Federal authorities, as well as large state and local police departments, typically have access to the tools, while smaller local agencies enlist the state or federal authorities to help on high-profile cases, they said.Law enforcement agencies that have purchased a GrayKey device include the Drug Enforcement Administration, which bought an advanced model this year for $30,000, according to public records. Maryland‚s state police have one, as do police departments in Portland, Ore., and Rochester, Minn., according to records. Hillar Moore, the district attorney in Baton Rouge, La., said his office had paid Cellebrite thousands of dollars to unlock iPhones in five cases since 2017, including an investigation into the hazing-related death of a fraternity pledge at Louisiana State University. He said the phones had yielded crucial information, and he was upset that Apple planned to close such a useful investigative avenue.‚They are blatantly protecting criminal activity, and only under the guise of privacy for their clients,‚ he said.Michael Sachs, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said his office uses workarounds ‚ he declined to specify which ‚ to access locked iPhones several times a week. That has helped solve a series of cases in recent months, including by getting into an iPhone to find videos of a suspect sexually assaulting a child. The man was convicted this year.In the first 10 months of 2017, the Manhattan district attorney‚s office said it had recovered and obtained warrants or consent to search 702 locked smartphones, two-thirds of which were iPhones. Smartphones running Google‚s Android software have been generally easier to access, partly because many older devices lack encryption.The encryption on smartphones applies only to data stored solely on the phone. Companies like Apple and Google regularly give law enforcement officials access to the data that consumers back up on their servers, such as via Apple‚s iCloud service. Apple said that since 2013, it has responded to more than 55,000 requests from the United States government seeking information about more than 208,000 devices, accounts or financial identifiers.The tussle over encrypted iPhones and opening them to help law enforcement is unlikely to simmer down. Federal officials have renewed a push for legislation that would require tech companies like Apple to provide the police with a backdoor into phones, though they were recently found to be overstating the number of devices they could not access.Apple probably won‚t make it any easier for the police if not forced by Congress, given that it has made the privacy and security of iPhones a central selling point. But the company has complied with local laws that conflict with its privacy push. In China, for instance, Apple recently began storing its Chinese customers‚ data on Chinese-run servers because of a new law there. Apple‚s latest move is part of a longer cat-and-mouse game between tech companies and law enforcement, said Michelle Richardson, an analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which supports protections for online privacy.‚People always expected there would be this back-and-forth ‚ that government would be able to hack into these devices, and then Apple would plug the hole and hackers would find another way in,‚ she said.",Apple to Close iPhone Security Hole That Law Enforcement Uses to Crack Devices,"June 13, 2018 /  8:16 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone-cracking/apple-to-undercut-popular-law-enforcement-tool-for-cracking-iphones-idUSKBN1J92ZY,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Wednesday it will change its iPhone settings to undercut the most popular means for law enforcement to break into the devices. The company told Reuters it was aiming to protect all customers, especially in countries where phones are readily obtained by police or by criminals with extensive resources, and to head off further spread of the attack technique. The privacy standard-bearer of the tech industry said it will change default settings in the iPhone operating system to cut off communication through the USB port when the phone has not been unlocked in the past hour. That port is how machines made by forensic companies GrayShift, Cellebrite and others connect and get around the security provisions that limit how many password guesses can be made before the device freezes them out or erases data. Now they will be unable to run code on the devices after the hour is up. These companies have marketed their machines to law enforcement in multiple countries this year, offering the machines themselves for thousands of dollars but also per-phone pricing as low as $50.  Apple representatives said the change in settings will protect customers in countries where law enforcement seizes and tries to crack phones with fewer legal restrictions than under U.S. law. They also noted that criminals, spies and unscrupulous people often use the same techniques. Even some of the methods most prized by intelligence agencies have been leaked on the internet. “We’re constantly strengthening the security protections in every Apple product to help customers defend against hackers, identity thieves and intrusions into their personal data,” Apple said in a prepared statement. “We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don’t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs.”  Apple began working on the USB issue before learning it was a favorite of law enforcement.  The setting switch had been documented in beta versions of iOS 11.4.1 and iOS12, and Apple told Reuters it will be made permanent in a forthcoming general release. FILE PHOTO: A customer views the new iPhone 7 smartphone inside an Apple Inc. store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoApple said that after it learned of the techniques, it reviewed the iPhone operating system code and improved security. It decided to simply alter the setting, a cruder way of preventing most of the potential access by unfriendly parties. With the changes, police or hackers will typically have an hour or less to get a phone to a cracking machine. That could cut access by as much as 90 percent, security researchers estimated.  This also could spur sales of cracking devices, as law enforcement looks to get more forensic machines closer to where seizures occur. Undoubtedly, researchers and police vendors will find new ways to break into phones, and Apple will then look to patch those vulnerabilities. The setting change could also draw criticism from U.S. law enforcement officials who have been engaged in an on-again, off-again campaign for legislation or other ways to force technology companies to maintain access to users’ communications. Apple has been the most prominent opponent of those demands. In 2016, it went to court to fight an order that it break into an iPhone 5c used by a killer in San Bernardino. Then-FBI Director James Comey told Congress that without compelling Apple to write new software to facilitate the digital break-in, there would be no way to learn if the shooter’s device contained evidence of a conspiracy. The FBI ultimately found a contractor that broke into the phone without Apple’s cooperation. Apple and most private security experts argue that government contractors and others can usually find means of cracking devices. They also say that weakening encryption by design would lead to more hacking by those outside of government. Until recently, current FBI Director Christopher Wray repeatedly claimed that the Bureau had been unable to get into more than 7,000 phones in 2017. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the true number was less than a third as high.

Nonetheless, three maintenance workers shortly before noon on Tuesday thought they could rouse the raccoon from its stupor and offered it a ladder to climb down from the ledge.It was the start of a mesmerizing escape ‚ captivating people in Minnesota and then nationwide on Twitter. The raccoon, clearly not ready to give up and not a fan of ladders, jolted from the recess of the building, dug its long fingernails into the tan exterior and scurried over to another side. It started to climb and climb and climb. Raccoons are skilled climbers with strong claws and will rapidly scurry up trees to escape danger. By rotating their hind feet, they can descend from trees headfirst, according to the book ‚Adirondack Mammals.‚The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources estimates that between 800,000 and one million raccoons live throughout the state. The St. Paul raccoon scaled the two-story building with ease. But there was a bigger challenge ahead: the UBS Plaza, a 25-story office tower and St. Paul‚s 15th-tallest building. Within minutes, the raccoon had ascended five stories. ‚Well, it‚s out of the frying pan, into the fire for the #mprraccoon,‚ Tim Nelson, a reporter at Minnesota Public Radio News who chronicled its adventure, tweeted with a hashtag that became a trending topic on Twitter.About 10 minutes later, the raccoon was pressed against the 12th floor, now a mere dark spot between two windows more than 100 feet above the street. Then the raccoon reached the 15th floor and then the 20th.While it‚s normal for raccoons to climb 20 or 30 feet, scaling a large building is very unusual, said Russell L. Burke, a biology professor at Hofstra University.‚That kind of height is extraordinary,‚ he added.By the time the raccoon reached the upper stories, it had an audience.Gawkers flooded the streets below UBS Plaza. Some brought binoculars. A girl clutched a raccoon stuffed animal. A marquee on Minnesota Public Radio‚s building across the street flashed the breaking news: ‚St. Paul‚s downtown raccoon reaches new heights.‚Inside the tower, employees pressed their faces against the windows hoping to catch a glimpse of it. On the 23rd floor of UBS Plaza, Sheila Donnelly-Coyne, a partner at Paige J. Donnelly, a St. Paul law firm, huddled with her co-workers and started to chronicle the raccoon‚s journey. Their thoughts raced. Who will rescue it? Will it fall?It showed up around 3 p.m. and started pacing on a thin window ledge outside Ms. Donnelly-Coyne‚s office. ‚He just seemed sweet and cute and very mellow,‚ she said in an interview on Wednesday.Breaking out a window or sending down window cleaners would have been too risky, Ms. Donnelly-Coyne said, so officials baited live traps with cat food and placed them on the roof. They hoped the smell would lure the animal up another two floors.Ms. Donnelly-Coyne stayed in the office until 9 p.m., taking breaks from her work to check on the raccoon. When she left, she said, the animal was curled up sleeping. ‚All they could do was put enough stinky food up there to encourage him to go up the last two floors,‚ she said. ‚We were all kind of worried he might be too tired to do so but thankfully the little guy kept going.‚The raccoon awoke around 10:30 p.m. and apparently had a change of heart. It started to descend, down to the 18th floor and then the 17th, before stopping on another ledge.A photographer at Minnesota Public Radio zoomed in and saw the raccoon peering over the ledge. Maybe it saw the cheering crowd below. Maybe it thought the descent was too far. Either way, around 2 a.m. on Wednesday, it began another climb.It surpassed the 18th floor and then 19th and kept going and going. Around 2:45 a.m., according to Mr. Nelson, it scaled the top and hopped onto the roof. It also found the cat food inside the trap. Wildlife Management Services, the company that set the traps, retrieved the raccoon on Wednesday morning, said Laurie Brickley, a spokeswoman for the city‚s Department of Safety and Inspections.The raccoon was a female about 2 years old, Ms. Brickley said. ‚She was a little skinny but in good shape,‚ she added.By the time the team reached the animal, it was ‚incredibly tired,‚ had eaten all that was in the live trap and had drunk a lot of water, Ms. Brickley said.Later, the company said on Facebook that the raccoon had been released on private residential property in the suburbs of the Twin Cities with permission from the owner, and after consultation with the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Minnesota.Ms. Donnelly-Coyne arrived at work on Wednesday to hear the good news. ‚Everybody was very, very relieved this morning,‚ she said, ‚that this story had a happy ending.‚Also relieved was her 14-year-old daughter, a vegetarian and animal rights advocate who would have been heartbroken if anything had happened to the raccoon, she said. ‚I was very happy I was able to tell her the little guy is fine.‚ But not everyone was rooting for a peaceful end. Raccoons can be vicious creatures, many people noted online. They attack pets and eat trash. They also carry rabies (though the disease is ‚quite rare‚ among Minnesota raccoons, the state says) and a deadly parasite they pass through their feces.

Atop the building animal control officers put pungent cat food in traps, the St. Paul Pioneer-Press reported. A reporter for the newspaper also tweeted that a private wildlife management company will release the animal “somewhere safe.”    “I am so proud of this little rascal - such a fricking champ!!!!,” said Dana Frazer as she watched a live feed of the raccoon’s climb on Periscope, a live streaming site.

Horowitz, chose for his office a portrait of the disgraced Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, who was nearly impeached, forced to resign in 1924 and later tried twice on charges of defrauding the government.Mr. Daugherty‚s visage serves as a reminder for Mr. Horowitz: Malfeasance is never far away.Equal parts auditor, investigator and cop, Mr. Horowitz has navigated his role as one of the most powerful arbiters of conflict in Washington ‚ the investigators‚ investigator ‚ with a diplomat‚s instinct for recognizing fault lines, a prosecutor‚s focus on justice and a Washington insider‚s knack for amassing allies on Capitol Hill.Now, he has been thrust into the clash of law enforcement and politics that has consumed much of the capital for the past two years. On Thursday, he will issue the highly anticipated findings of his examination of the F.B.I.‚s handling of its investigation into Hillary Clinton‚s use of a private email server. He is expected to castigate the decision making by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey; his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe; and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Another high-profile test looms beyond that. Mr. Horowitz, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has begun a review of aspects of the Russia investigation. His findings could land in 2020 amid the presidential race.In interviews with nearly two dozen friends, former colleagues and political leaders, a portrait emerged of Mr. Horowitz as a principled, savvy investigator. Mr. Horowitz is good-humored and even-tempered, said past co-workers, who ribbed him for his cameos as a prosecutor on ‚K Street,‚ HBO‚s short-lived 2003 show about lobbyists. He delivered lines like, ‚You need to have at least a general understanding of the financial flow of funds,‚ with the √©lan of a career civil servant.He has faced criticism over his most highly charged reports, including on the Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal. In it, he offered harsh assessments about one official, but critics expressed concern that the report inflated the official‚s role in the episode.His allies said that attacks were inevitable. In the Fast and Furious report, ‚I disagreed with some of Michael‚s conclusions, but not his motives,‚ said John Roth, a former federal prosecutor and former inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security. ‚You don‚t take this job to make a lot of friends.‚ Mr. Horowitz, 55, grew up in Suffern, N.Y., his mother a purveyor of antiques and his father the owner of the women‚s clothing maker Paul Allen. He attended Brandeis University and Harvard Law School and later married Alexandra Kauffman, then a field producer at CNN. In 1991, Mr. Horowitz joined the federal prosecutor‚s office in Manhattan, where he briefly overlapped with Mr. Comey. He led a huge investigation that implicated almost an entire police precinct in Harlem in a scandal involving drug dealing, robbery and bribery.‚It took an extraordinary amount of independence,‚ said Mary Jo White, the former United States attorney in Manhattan. ‚Prosecutors work with police on their cases, so he was investigating and prosecuting, in effect, his partners in law enforcement.‚ He won an award from the attorney general, and Ms. White named him head of her office‚s public corruption section.In 1999, Mr. Horowitz moved to Washington to join the Justice Department‚s criminal division and became chief of staff to its leader, James K. Robinson, where his judgment was lauded. ‚He had to know what to ask the prosecutors, without having intimate knowledge of a case, judge the quality of the incoming information and send it to the boss,‚ said Shan Wu, who was counsel to Attorney General Janet Reno, noting that Mr. Horowitz took notes on a single notecard and simply remembered the rest of the information.Mr. Horowitz left the Justice Department in 2002 to join Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft as a defense lawyer and was later nominated by President George W. Bush to the United States Sentencing Commission. In 2012, President Barack Obama tapped him to be the Justice Department‚s inspector general.By the time Mr. Horowitz started his job, his office was well into its investigation of the Fast and Furious scandal, a botched operation in which officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives let guns enter Mexico in the hopes of tracing them back to criminals.Mr. Horowitz handled the politically fraught situation by reaching out to Democrats and Republicans on the congressional oversight committees. In a meeting with former Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, and Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, Mr. Horowitz told them about his own conflicts of interest and said he had assigned others in his office to handle those parts of the investigation. ‚It went a long way to help bolster our confidence that he‚d call balls and strikes fairly,‚ Mr. Chaffetz said, adding that no inspector general had taken that step before with him.Mr. Horowitz‚s eventual report faulted law enforcement officials for poor communication and a failure to see red flags. He assigned significant blame to Jason Weinstein, the deputy assistant attorney general of the Criminal Division. Mr. Horowitz was critiqued for focusing too much on a career prosecutor in Washington, rather than the A.T.F. leaders in Arizona, the center of the operation, or the department‚s top political appointees.Mr. Weinstein accused Mr. Horowitz of using him as a scapegoat.‚I have been singled out because of the desire to blame someone of rank within Main Justice, even though my only knowledge about Fast and Furious consisted of repeated false assurances from those who supervised the investigation,‚ Mr. Weinstein said in a statement at the time.Others defended Mr. Horowitz‚s report. It ‚was highly critical of the department and was accepted by both sides of the aisle,‚ said Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the leading Democrat on the oversight committee.Mr. Horowitz also leveraged his tactical know-how amid an internecine battle with the F.B.I. over documents and other information that his office viewed as essential to perform oversight. The bureau had refused requests to turn over the material.He became a key behind-the-scenes player in the 2016 passage of a law intended to reinforce the power of inspectors general, working with colleagues to lobby all 72 government watchdogs at the time to sign a letter to lawmakers outlining their challenges. Two years earlier, only 47 had signed a similar letter. ‚An access issue for one I.G. is an access issue for all of us,‚ said Allison C. Lerner, the inspector general at the National Science Foundation. ‚Michael thought that we had to speak out as a community on that fundamental issue, and many of us agreed.‚Mr. Horowitz ensured the backing of his fellow inspectors general again after the 2016 election by helping protect them from political interference, in large part through his relationships with lawmakers.At the time, Trump transition officials had told some inspectors general they would be replaced. But under longstanding norms, they are treated more like judges, who decide when to leave. Mr. Horowitz immediately reached out to allies on Capitol Hill; no one was let go. ‚Congress understands that I.G.‚s are often their main source of desperately needed information on routine and significant threats to the agencies,‚ said Paul C. Light, a New York University professor who studies the offices.Now, Mr. Trump poses a unique threat to Mr. Horowitz and his credibility as a neutral judge.Responding to Justice Department officials and Congress, Mr. Horowitz initiated in March a review of the F.B.I.‚s surveillance of Carter Page, the former Trump campaign official. But Mr. Trump‚s proclamations that the bureau had abused its power contributed to a perception that the Justice Department was conceding to his wishes, rather than acting independently.Still, law enforcement officials may have put some distance from the president‚s order by referring it to Mr. Horowitz. ‚No one orders inspectors general to do things,‚ Mr. Light said. ‚They determine the agenda. They take input and decide whether to accept the request.‚Mr. Horowitz has already issued a short but scathing report that found Mr. McCabe had lacked candor about his dealings with a journalist. Mr. Trump crowed about the findings as he had when Mr. McCabe was fired hours before he was eligible for retirement. ‚He LIED! LIED! LIED!,‚ Mr. Trump said on Twitter, adding, ‚McCabe is Comey!!‚""No one, not even an independent inspector general, is fully immune from the type of political pressure that has been applied in Mr. McCabe‚s case,‚ Michael R. Bromwich, a former inspector general who represents both Mr. McCabe and Mr. Weinstein, wrote in a statement.Mr. Trump is already laying the groundwork to attack Mr. Horowitz‚s coming report. ‚What is taking so long with the Inspector General‚s Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey,‚ he wrote on Twitter this month. ‚Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker!‚ But Mr. Horowitz‚s alliances, cultivated over years in Washington, may serve to pad him from the president‚s criticism. Mr. Gowdy, who as the chairman of the House oversight committee has been one of the Justice Department‚s sharpest critics, called him ‚professional, fair, fact-centric and evenhanded.‚Added Mr. Chaffetz: ‚Republicans and Democrats alike really need to take to heart whatever it is he finds, even if it doesn‚t fit our political agendas. People will spin and throw political barbs, but if you read the actual text, my gut is that‚s the truth.‚",Justice Dept.

REUTERS/Ronen ZvulunIn response to questions from Democrats during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Chris Wray said his office was “aggressively investigating a number of leaks,” but offered no details. Monday’s Senate hearing followed publication last week of a report by FBI Inspector General Michael Horowitz that concluded that former FBI Director James Comey made a “serious error of judgment” when he announced he was reopening an investigation into candidate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server a few weeks before the election. Comey became a controversial figure in the 2016 election, drawing accusations from Republicans and Democrats that his handling of an investigation into Clinton’s emails influenced the campaign. The 500 page Horowitz report also concluded that Comey did not exhibit any political bias in his actions or try to influence the election and did not contest the FBI’s decision not to prosecute Clinton for the email affair. At Monday’s hearing, Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy asked Horowitz if his office had investigated “the leaks of FBI personnel who were actively taking steps to sway the election to Mr. Trump” in his report on the FBI’s handling of an investigation into Clinton’s use of email server. “That’s correct ... We are not able to speak to you about work that might be ongoing,” Horowitz replied. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed last Friday that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s office was still probing possible leaks to Giuliani or other Trump supporters. At Monday’s Senate hearing, FBI Director Wray said he was unaware of any ongoing leaks to Giuliani, who now represents the president in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.The hearing was the first of two scheduled this week to examine the Horowitz report. Democrats have repeatedly raised questions about leaks to Giuliani because of public comments he made before the election.  Two days before Comey reported to Congress in October 2016 that the FBI was reopening the probe to review the newly discovered Clinton emails, Giuliani appeared on Fox News and predicted some “pretty big surprises” about Clinton. Horowitz’s report said that a group of retired FBI agents was briefed on the Clinton email investigation on October 21, 2016, days before Comey’s announcement. The report also discusses widespread problems with leaks to the media and said senior FBI officials were afraid that some officials in the bureau’s New York field office were behind some of the leaks. Comey has previously said he commissioned an internal probe into the leaks. Trump fired Comey as head of the FBI in May 2017, prompting the appointment of a special counsel now pursuing the Russia probe. Reporting by Sarah N.

Turnbull said on Wednesday the government would adopt 104 of the 122 recommendations posed by the inquiry, called a Royal Commission, which includes a national redress scheme that provides financial and legal services to victims. The government is still considering the remaining 18 recommendations, including a proposal that Australia introduce a law forcing religious leaders to report child abuse.  The proposed law would capture Catholic priests told of abuse during confession, clashing with a central tenet of Catholicism, the confidentiality of the confessional.       It is rare for the Australian government to issue a national apology, which is reserved for egregious misdeeds where the state has played a role.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said if all states and institutions across Australia opt in the scheme could provide support to around 60,000 people. The scheme will target people sexually abused as children while in the care of a Commonwealth institution and follows a nationwide inquiry that found widespread institutionalized child sexual abuse in Australia. Redress is offered as an alternative to taking compensation through the courts. It can include access to psychological counseling, a direct personal response such as an apology from the responsible institution for people who want it, and a monetary payment. Payments are capped at A$150,000.  “We support the Royal Commission’s recommendation for a national redress scheme, administered by the Commonwealth, and we are keen to participate,” said Archbishop Mark Coleridge, president of The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference (ACBC). “Survivors deserve justice and healing and many have bravely come forward to tell their stories,” he said in the joint statement with Catholic Religious Australia (CRA). The redress scheme, which is before parliament now, is slated to begin on 1 July and last for 10 years. “We recognize that redress will not take away a survivor’s pain, but hope that it can provide some practical assistance in the journey toward recovery from abuse,” said Ruth Durick, president of Catholic Religious Australia, whose membership consists of more than 130 congregations country wide.  “We are committed to providing redress to survivors who were abused within the Catholic Church.” Almost 2,500 survivors gave evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse about sexual abuse in an institution managed by the Catholic Church. According to the Royal Commission’s final report, 61.8 per cent of all survivors of sexual abuse in a religious institution were from a Catholic-managed institution. Other institutions involved include places such as the Australian Defence Forces cadet schools and onshore immigration detention. The Australian government welcomed the Catholic Church’s announcement. “The Royal Commission put the horrific experiences of survivors on the public record and now the Redress Scheme will officially acknowledge them and continue the process of healing,” Turnbull said in a statement. “Every government institution must take responsibility for the abuse that occurred on its watch, and pay the cost of providing redress.” Reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Michael PerryOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Australian Catholic Church to enter into redress scheme for sex abuse survivors,Y

Stephenson, AT&T‚s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.The Justice Department had six days to seek an injunction after a federal judge approved AT&T‚s purchase of Time Warner on Tuesday. The judge‚s decision is expected to prompt a series of other mergers, especially in the media industry. However, the Justice Department still has 60 days from the date of the ruling to file an appeal, even if the companies close the merger, and such a filing remained a possibility.‚We are still considering whether or not to appeal,‚ a spokesman for the department said Thursday.There was a time limit on when the government could seek an injunction, because the merger agreement between the companies expires on June 21. If an injunction had been granted, the companies would have had to extend the date or AT&T would have had to pay Time Warner $500 million in what is known as a reverse termination fee.AT&T can now take advantage of Time Warner‚s business to develop new lines of revenue. The phone giant plans to marry its subscriber data with Time Warner‚s TV networks to sell targeted advertising, which sells at higher rates. The company is also looking to tap its creative engine to generate new forms of video for mobile devices.Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, has agreed to stay on as a ‚senior advisor during a transition period,‚ according to the statement.The leaders of Time Warner‚s units ‚ Richard Plepler at HBO, Kevin Tsujihara at Warner Bros. and John Martin at Turner ‚ will now report to John Stankey, a 30-year veteran of AT&T and chief executive of its media division. The Justice Department had challenged the deal, saying the telecom company‚s acquisition of Time Warner would lead to fewer choices for consumers and higher prices for television and internet services. But the judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, ruled emphatically in favor of the companies.He also took the unusual step of strongly warning the government against trying to stop the merger with an emergency stay.The defeat of the government‚s antitrust challenge raises questions about the future of merger reviews and whether the agency will be able to aggressively resist corporate consolidation going forward.Makan Delrahim, the head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, had been adamant that the merger should be opposed because he said that cable subscribers would see higher prices and the development of streaming video would be hampered by the merger.The agency could have a difficult time winning an appeal, many experts said. The judge‚s ruling was narrow and avoided sweeping statements about antitrust laws or other cases, the experts said.‚The ultimate question is whether Judge Leon made legal conclusions that are unconventional or controversial,‚ said Paul Glenchur, a senior telecommunications analyst for Hedgeye Potomac Research. ‚We think he largely avoided the possible pitfalls.‚",AT&T Closes Acquisition of Time Warner,"June 14, 2018 /  9:28 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc, the No. 2 wireless carrier, on Thursday closed its $85 billion deal to acquire media company Time Warner Inc after U.S. antitrust regulators indicated they would not seek a delay. Coaxial TV Cables are seen in front of AT&T and Time Warner logos in this picture illustration taken June 13, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationThe deal, first announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump. AT&T was sued by the Justice Department, but won approval from a judge to move forward with the deal on Tuesday following a six-week trial. The Justice Department still has 60 days to appeal the decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, even though the deal has closed. Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled on Tuesday that the deal to marry AT&T’s wireless and satellite businesses with Time Warner’s movies and television shows was legal under antitrust law. The Justice Department had argued the deal would harm consumers. U.S. President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Time Warner’s CNN coverage, denounced the deal when it was announced in October 2016. In its lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal, filed in November 2017, the Justice Department said that AT&T’s ownership of both DirecTV and Time Warner, especially its Turner subsidiary, would give AT&T unfair leverage against rival pay TV providers that relied on content like CNN and HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” The AT&T ruling is expected to trigger a wave of mergers in the media sector, which has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google. The first to come was Comcast Corp’s $65 billion bid on Wednesday for the entertainment assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. AT&T had been worried about closing its deal ahead of a June 21 deadline if the government won a stay pending an appeal. Any stay could take the deal beyond a June 21 deadline for completing the merger, which could allow Time Warner to walk away or renegotiate the proposed transaction with AT&T. The government may have a difficult time winning on appeal because of the way Judge Leon wrote his opinion, four antitrust experts said. “I don’t think this would be overturned. It is so rooted in the facts that I would be surprised if an appellate court overturned such a fact-laden opinion,” said Michael Carrier, who teaches law at Rutgers. In a scathing opinion bit.ly/2Jxx6qE, Leon found little to support the government's arguments that the deal would harm consumers, calling the evidence for one argument against the deal ""gossamer thin"" and another ""poppycock."" The merger, including debt, would be the fourth largest deal ever attempted in the global telecom, media and entertainment space, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would also be the 12th largest deal in any sector, the data showed.

There were a few gamblers who were prepared to wager thousands of dollars, and many others who wanted to make bets that were much more modest, arriving simply to be part of a moment that felt historic.Scott Cronick was among the first to make it to the betting window, following state officials and Julius Erving, the retired basketball player, in placing some of the first legal bets on sporting events in New Jersey. He bet that the Yankees would win the World Series, the 76ers would claim the N.B.A. title and the Cowboys would be the Super Bowl champions.‚I made a lot of dumb bets today as a fan,‚ said Mr. Cronick, a radio broadcaster from nearby Somers Point. ‚I‚ll make smarter bets as we go on.‚ The Borgata and Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport were the only places prepared to accept gamblers as sports betting started in New Jersey, and both were inundated with people apparently delighted to have the chance to part ways with their money. At both venues, officials described the moment in soaring terms ‚ as the dawn of a ‚new era‚ in New Jersey, and a significant opportunity to invigorate lagging Atlantic City casinos and the state‚s racetracks. It also represented the culmination of a legal battle that stretched on for nearly a decade, ending on Thursday morning as Gov. Philip D. Murphy held up slips of paper no larger than baseball cards ‚ receipts with tiny black text showing his bets.$20, Germany to win the World Cup, 7-2 odds. $20, Devils to win the Stanley Cup, 40-1 odds.‚There‚s an old adage that you bet with your head, not with your heart,‚ Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said at Monmouth Park, near the Jersey Shore. ‚So, for the past seven years, our heads and our hearts were in alignment as we fought to overturn an unlawful and unfair federal law.‚A landmark Supreme Court ruling last month cleared the way by setting aside a federal law that had effectively barred sports betting in most of the country. Mr. Murphy signed a bill on Monday passed by the State Legislature that formally legalized wagering. The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa was the only casino positioned to immediately take bets, having transformed betting windows at its horse-racing facility into a temporary sports-gambling site until a permanent venue is completed. It was a race to be ready in time. At Monmouth Park, Ryan Orner, the manager of the facility‚s sports book, was barking last-minute reminders just moments before the governor placed his bets.‚Remember, cash first, then ticket,‚ he said. ‚And smile.‚Charles Rutkowski, 32, waited in line at Monmouth holding his 10-month-old son, Connor, as he analyzed the huge black boards above the betting window that listed odds on baseball and soccer, among other events.‚We‚re going to bet on the Yankees, some future bets, to mark the significance of the day,‚ he said, surprised by the wait. ‚I didn‚t think the lines would be this long. I thought people had work.‚ Other gamblers took bigger risks.‚This is the year: $100 to win on the Browns,‚ said Ryan Daly, 28, who was born and raised in New Jersey, yet somehow wound up a fan of the Cleveland Browns, who failed to win a single game last season. He noted that given the Browns‚ long odds, he stood to make substantial money should a miracle occur and the team wins the Super Bowl.‚Pays $7,500,‚ he said, flashing his ticket.At the Borgata, Kele Munoz posed for a selfie as she waited in line. She was also prepared to make a hefty gamble: $2,000 that her home country, Brazil, would win the World Cup. She had just returned from Las Vegas, but she had to leave there before she could place a bet. ‚It was like fate,‚ said Ms. Munoz, who missed work on Thursday to head to the casino from West New York, N.J.As betting got underway, the Borgata‚s race- and sports-betting book was stuffed with local politicians, camera crews and in the front row, Mr. Erving, known by his fans as Dr. J, who made the first bet at the Borgata. The crowd roared when he wagered $5 ‚on the Eagles to repeat.‚ Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and the State Senate president, showed off the receipt for his $200 bet on the Green Bay Packers to win the Super Bowl. ‚This was a seven-year battle,‚ he said of the protracted process to legalize sports betting. He cautioned that sports betting was unlikely to bring about a windfall in tax revenue, but it stood to bolster Atlantic City. ‚This is a game changer,‚ he said.Some noted that they had gambled on sporting events long before Thursday, but they were relieved the process was now legal. ‚Finally,‚ Mr. Cronick said, ‚I don‚t have to go to my corner bookie.‚Johannes Jenkins has lived in Atlantic City for about 30 years. ‚I‚m glad we‚ve got it,‚ he said as he waited to place his bet on the Phillies. ‚It works in Vegas,‚ he added, ‚it will probably work here, too.‚The crowds continued to file into Monmouth Park into the afternoon. Tommy Mahon was on his way to the beach in Long Branch from his home in Hazlet. He carried his beach chair with him as he got in line to bet, in case he needed to rest in the long lines. ‚You just can‚t beat the Jersey Shore in the summertime,‚ he said, as he pocketed his $50 bet on Russia to win the first game of the World Cup.

(Reuters) - With two $20 bets and a rambunctious crowd awaiting their turn, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy placed the state’s very first legal sports bets on Thursday, capping a years-long battle to end the ban on sports betting in the Garden State.”  This is a huge step forward for gaming, for the tracks, for the economy of this state,” Murphy said before placing his bets, with a crowd of media swarming him as he stepped to the counter at Monmouth Park Racetrack. Murphy’s wagers - that Germany will win the World Cup and the New Jersey Devils will take home hockey’s Stanley Cup next year - may not seem monumental. But the beginning of legal sports betting in New Jersey likely paves the way for much of the rest of the United States to eventually regulate and tax it. While sports betting is legal in many other countries, a 1992 U.S. law barred it in the United States except for a limited number of states, such as Nevada, where casinos have long included sports betting. New Jersey voters agreed in 2011 to change the state’s constitution to legalize sports betting, in part as an economic and revenue boost to the state’s ailing horse racetracks and gambling hub Atlantic City. State lawmakers quickly passed bills to legalize it, but professional sports leagues pushed back in court, arguing that it was illegal under the old federal law and that sports could be more easily corrupted due to increased money at stake. But in May, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with New Jersey and overturned the 1992 law. Now West Virginia, Connecticut, Mississippi and New York are looking to bring sports wagering out of the shadows, with other states are likely to follow.

REUTERS/Mike SegarSPORTS, BEER AND BETS As Murphy placed the first official wagers, a crowd of hundreds, energized by finally being able to bet on their favorite teams, lined up eagerly at Monmouth Park. They picked up forms listing the day’s games for various sports and placed bets with clerks at one of at least a dozen counters at the $2 million sports betting parlor built by William Hill PLC’s U.S. division.In an adjacent bar, the mostly male crowd that could place bets and grab a beer watched and cheered at televisions streaming golf, horse racing, baseball and soccer. Larry Cook, 47, was there to bet on baseball’s New York Yankees. He said he already likes to gamble in Atlantic City, and enjoys sports, so being able to wager on the sports he already watches is a perfect melding of two worlds. Plus, he appreciates that some of the betting money will make its way to his state, an unusual refrain from heavily taxed New Jerseyans. “If I’m gonna lose, at least it’s going to a good cause,” he said. He drove an hour to place his bet. But once sports betting launches at the Meadowlands Racetrack closer to home, he said he will go there instead. Joseph Correnti, 30, also drove an hour from his home the night before to stay with a friend nearby. He was among the first to place bets.

There were a few gamblers who were prepared to wager thousands of dollars, and many others who wanted to make bets that were much more modest, arriving simply to be part of a moment that felt historic.Scott Cronick was among the first to make it to the betting window, following state officials and Julius Erving, the retired basketball player, in placing some of the first legal bets on sporting events in New Jersey. He bet that the Yankees would win the World Series, the 76ers would claim the N.B.A. title and the Cowboys would be the Super Bowl champions.‚I made a lot of dumb bets today as a fan,‚ said Mr. Cronick, a radio broadcaster from nearby Somers Point. ‚I‚ll make smarter bets as we go on.‚ The Borgata and Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport were the only places prepared to accept gamblers as sports betting started in New Jersey, and both were inundated with people apparently delighted to have the chance to part ways with their money. At both venues, officials described the moment in soaring terms ‚ as the dawn of a ‚new era‚ in New Jersey, and a significant opportunity to invigorate lagging Atlantic City casinos and the state‚s racetracks. It also represented the culmination of a legal battle that stretched on for nearly a decade, ending on Thursday morning as Gov. Philip D. Murphy held up slips of paper no larger than baseball cards ‚ receipts with tiny black text showing his bets.$20, Germany to win the World Cup, 7-2 odds. $20, Devils to win the Stanley Cup, 40-1 odds.‚There‚s an old adage that you bet with your head, not with your heart,‚ Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said at Monmouth Park, near the Jersey Shore. ‚So, for the past seven years, our heads and our hearts were in alignment as we fought to overturn an unlawful and unfair federal law.‚A landmark Supreme Court ruling last month cleared the way by setting aside a federal law that had effectively barred sports betting in most of the country. Mr. Murphy signed a bill on Monday passed by the State Legislature that formally legalized wagering. The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa was the only casino positioned to immediately take bets, having transformed betting windows at its horse-racing facility into a temporary sports-gambling site until a permanent venue is completed. It was a race to be ready in time. At Monmouth Park, Ryan Orner, the manager of the facility‚s sports book, was barking last-minute reminders just moments before the governor placed his bets.‚Remember, cash first, then ticket,‚ he said. ‚And smile.‚Charles Rutkowski, 32, waited in line at Monmouth holding his 10-month-old son, Connor, as he analyzed the huge black boards above the betting window that listed odds on baseball and soccer, among other events.‚We‚re going to bet on the Yankees, some future bets, to mark the significance of the day,‚ he said, surprised by the wait. ‚I didn‚t think the lines would be this long. I thought people had work.‚ Other gamblers took bigger risks.‚This is the year: $100 to win on the Browns,‚ said Ryan Daly, 28, who was born and raised in New Jersey, yet somehow wound up a fan of the Cleveland Browns, who failed to win a single game last season. He noted that given the Browns‚ long odds, he stood to make substantial money should a miracle occur and the team wins the Super Bowl.‚Pays $7,500,‚ he said, flashing his ticket.At the Borgata, Kele Munoz posed for a selfie as she waited in line. She was also prepared to make a hefty gamble: $2,000 that her home country, Brazil, would win the World Cup. She had just returned from Las Vegas, but she had to leave there before she could place a bet. ‚It was like fate,‚ said Ms. Munoz, who missed work on Thursday to head to the casino from West New York, N.J.As betting got underway, the Borgata‚s race- and sports-betting book was stuffed with local politicians, camera crews and in the front row, Mr. Erving, known by his fans as Dr. J, who made the first bet at the Borgata. The crowd roared when he wagered $5 ‚on the Eagles to repeat.‚ Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and the State Senate president, showed off the receipt for his $200 bet on the Green Bay Packers to win the Super Bowl. ‚This was a seven-year battle,‚ he said of the protracted process to legalize sports betting. He cautioned that sports betting was unlikely to bring about a windfall in tax revenue, but it stood to bolster Atlantic City. ‚This is a game changer,‚ he said.Some noted that they had gambled on sporting events long before Thursday, but they were relieved the process was now legal. ‚Finally,‚ Mr. Cronick said, ‚I don‚t have to go to my corner bookie.‚Johannes Jenkins has lived in Atlantic City for about 30 years. ‚I‚m glad we‚ve got it,‚ he said as he waited to place his bet on the Phillies. ‚It works in Vegas,‚ he added, ‚it will probably work here, too.‚The crowds continued to file into Monmouth Park into the afternoon. Tommy Mahon was on his way to the beach in Long Branch from his home in Hazlet. He carried his beach chair with him as he got in line to bet, in case he needed to rest in the long lines. ‚You just can‚t beat the Jersey Shore in the summertime,‚ he said, as he pocketed his $50 bet on Russia to win the first game of the World Cup. (They did, beating Saudi Arabia 5-0). C.J. Pulcine, who is also from Hazlet, said he spent Wednesday night doing his research so he knew which team to bet.‚I‚ve been looking forward to this since they first mentioned it in 2012,‚ Mr. Pulcine said.

FILE PHOTO: People walk outside the Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, U.S., September 1, 2014.   REUTERS/Tom Mihalek/File PhotoThe legislation now goes to Governor Phil Murphy, who would have to sign it before operators could start taking sports wagers. He is not expected to sign it this week, according to his office. The bill contains none of the fraud-fighting measures requested by professional sports leagues, including real-time game data sharing with casinos and state regulators, as well as fees to the leagues to help pay for expanded monitoring and investigations. New Jersey and other states are racing for a piece of the estimated $150 billion spent on illegal annual wagers in the United States, after the top court in May overturned a 1992 law that had banned sports wagering except in a few places, including Las Vegas. More Americans now than ever, 69 percent, say gambling is morally acceptable, according to a Gallup poll released on Thursday. Delaware, which already had limited sports wagers, rolled out full-scale betting on Tuesday. In New Jersey, the U.S. unit of UK-based William Hill PLC has for years been preparing sports books at Monmouth Park Racetrack. In the state’s fiscally stressed gambling hub Atlantic City, William Hill also plans to operate a 7,500-square-foot, $6 million sports betting area at the twice-bankrupt former Revel Casino Hotel, which is now called the Ocean Resort Casino and is set to open later in June. London-listed gambling companies, facing tighter regulations and higher taxes in their home markets, are likely to seek expansion across the Atlantic, especially as sports betting is set to grow in the United States. The Dublin-based bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair agreed in May, after the U.S. high-court’s ruling, to merge its U.S. business with fantasy sports giant FanDuel. New Jersey itself is expected to pull in between $12 million and $17 million in the first full year of operation, according to legislative estimates.  That would be a tiny drop in the bucket for New Jersey’s proposed $37.4 billion budget for fiscal 2019, which is still being finalized. The projection is based on an assumption that 28 percent of the state’s population will bet on sports and on the 8.5 percent tax rate on gross revenues from in-person wagering. The state can also impose a 13 percent tax on internet sports bets, which could begin 30 days after the law goes into effect.

Trump Foundation, accusing the charity and the Trump family of sweeping violations of campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegal coordination with the presidential campaign.The lawsuit, which seeks to dissolve the foundation and bar President Trump and three of his children from serving on nonprofit organizations, was an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting president. The attorney general also sent referral letters to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission for possible further action, adding to Mr. Trump‚s extensive legal challenges.The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, culminated a nearly two-year investigation of Mr. Trump‚s charity, which became a subject of scrutiny during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. While such foundations are supposed to be devoted to charitable activities, the petition asserts that Mr. Trump‚s was often improperly used to settle legal claims against his various businesses, even spending $10,000 on a portrait of Mr. Trump that was hung at one of his golf clubs.The foundation was also used to curry political favor, the lawsuit asserts. During the 2016 race, the foundation became a virtual arm of Mr. Trump‚s campaign, email traffic showed, with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, directing its expenditures, even though such foundations are explicitly prohibited from political activities. The attorney general‚s office is seeking the Trump Foundation to pay $2.8 million in restitution, the amount raised for the foundation at a 2016 Iowa political fund-raiser. At the time, Mr. Trump skipped a Republican debate and set up his own event to raise money for veterans, though he used the event to skewer his opponents and celebrate his own accomplishments.Mr. Trump immediately attacked the lawsuit, characterizing it in a Twitter post as an attempt by the ‚sleazy New York Democrats‚ to damage him by suing the foundation, and vowing not to settle the case ‚ much as he did when the same office filed a lawsuit accusing Trump University. (Mr. Trump in 2016 paid a $25 million settlement to resolve the inquiry.)  The $10,000 portrait of Mr. Trump was one of ‚at least five self-dealing transactions‚ facilitated by the foundation, according to the attorney general‚s office, violating tax regulations that prohibit using nonprofit charities for private interests. In 2007, to settle a dispute between the City of Palm Beach and Mr. Trump‚s Mar-a-Lago resort, the foundation paid $100,000 to the Fisher House Foundation, another charity.In 2012, a man named Martin B. Greenberg sued the Trump National Golf Club after he made a hole in one at a fund-raising golf tournament that had promised to pay $1 million to golfers who aced the 13th hole, as he did. As part of a settlement, the charitable foundation paid $158,000 to a foundation run by Mr. Greenberg.The foundation also paid $5,000 to one organization for ‚promotional space featuring Trump International Hotels,‚ and another $32,000 to satisfy a pledge made by a privately held entity controlled by Mr. Trump to a charitable land trust.[For more on the foundation: The Donald J. Trump Foundation, Explained]The foundation lawsuit, and the referrals to the federal agencies, are the latest of Mr. Trump‚s voluminous legal challenges, starting with the ongoing investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.The attorney general‚s action is also likely to embolden critics who have accused Mr. Trump of flouting legal norms. Mr. Trump has suggested he might pardon himself in the Mueller investigation and has repeatedly assailed the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ‚As our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,‚ said Barbara D. Underwood, New York‚s attorney general, who has been on the job a little over a month. ‚This is not how private foundations should function and my office intends to hold the foundation accountable for its misuse of charitable assets.‚Many of the examples cited in the lawsuit were first reported by The Washington Post.Numerous state and federal laws preclude nonprofit organizations and charities like the Trump Foundation from lobbying, aiding a political campaign, or giving undue benefits that further a person‚s self-interests, rather than those of the organization. The restrictions are in place to ensure that donations are used for the expressed purpose of the nonprofits; violations can result in penalties, including revocation of the organization‚s nonprofit status.The petition notes that Mr. Trump himself signed annual I.R.S. filings, under penalty of perjury, in which he attested that the foundation did not engage in political activity. ‚This statutory prohibition is absolute.‚Yet after the Iowa fund-raiser, Mr. Trump‚s foundation ‚ceded control over the charitable funds it raised to senior Trump campaign staff, who dictated the manner in which the foundation would disburse those proceeds, directing the timing, amounts and recipients of the grants,‚ according to the petition.That same month, an official at the foundation emailed Mr. Lewandowski, who was Mr. Trump‚s campaign manager at the time, telling him ‚we should start thinking about how you want to distribute the funds collected.‚Mr. Lewandowski, in a reply, wrote that ‚I think we should get the total collected and then put out a press release that we distributed the $$ to each of the groups.‚ He later sent a list of veterans‚ groups ‚purportedly approved by Mr. Trump to receive grants from the Foundation.‚ The list was created by another campaign staffer, Lisa Maciejowski Gambuzza, and edited by a third, Stuart Jolly, a political director. And Mr. Lewandowski asked that some of the disbursements be made in Iowa in the days before that state‚s presidential nominating caucuses, which mark the kickoff of the primary calendar.Allowing the campaign to control the spending of the foundation‚s charitable funds represented coordination between the two entities, as well as ‚an improper in-kind contribution of no less than $2.823 million (the amount donated to the foundation) to the campaign,‚ according to the lawsuit.Beyond the restitution, the foundation and its directors could face several million dollars in additional penalties, depending on how the court rules. The attorney general‚s office is also seeking to bar the president from serving as a director, officer or trustee of another nonprofit for 10 years.Likewise, the petition seeks to bar Mr. Trump‚s three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, from the boards of nonprofits based in New York or that operate in New York for one year, which would have the effect of barring them from a wide range of groups based in other states.While the three eldest children ostensibly served on the foundation board from 2006 to 2017, the board never even met after 1999, according to the petition, which called the foundation ‚an empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors.‚The action could force Mr. Trump‚s children to curtail relationships with a variety of organizations. Last year, for example, Ms. Trump said she created a charitable fund, the Ivanka M. Trump Charitable Fund, to receive the unpaid portion of her book advance and any future royalties. In her government ethics report disclosed on Monday, she said she donated $289,300 to the fund. However, no publicly filed reports are available for that group yet. After the election, Eric Trump distanced himself from his charitable foundation, which has also been under investigation by the attorney general‚s office related to shifting its resources to the Trump Organization.Mr. Trump long feuded with Ms. Underwood‚s predecessor, Eric Schneiderman, who resigned last month amid a scandal involving allegations that he had physically abused a number of his girlfriends. Weeks after the 2016 election, Mr. Schneiderman‚s office issued a ‚notice of violation‚ to the foundation, which had already attracted scrutiny over its practices, and ordered it to immediately stop soliciting charitable donations in the state.Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, released a statement from the Trump Foundation on Thursday that characterized the lawsuit as ‚politics at its very worst.‚ The statement accused Mr. Schneiderman of using the foundation investigation ‚to not only advance his own political goals, but also for his own political fund-raising,‚ and suggested that Ms. Underwood has shown that ‚such political attacks will continue unabated.‚Mr. Schneiderman‚s resignation had raised questions whether his office, which had been at the heart of the Democratic legal resistance against the Trump administration, would persist in such efforts.By filing the lawsuit, Ms. Underwood, who is a career prosecutor rather than a politician, seems inclined to do so.She also recently accused Mr. Trump of ‚undermining the rule of law‚ with his pardon practices. She made the comment when she announced she was continuing an effort begun under Mr. Schneiderman to change New York‚s double-jeopardy law so that state and local prosecutors would have the power to bring criminal charges against aides to Mr. Trump who have been pardoned.The Trump Foundation has been in legal limbo since after the election, when the president wanted to dissolve it amid growing controversy about its practices. But in late 2016, a spokeswoman for the attorney general‚s office, Amy Spitalnick, said the foundation ‚cannot legally dissolve‚ while it is under investigation.The attorney general‚s referrals to the I.R.S. and the F.E.C. could add another wrinkle that might slow the foundation‚s dissolution. The agencies are not known for their expeditious handling of enforcement actions, and the lawsuit notes that the foundation cannot legally complete its wind down ‚until the complaints to the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Election Commission have been resolved and it is determined if any penalties or fines will be imposed on the foundation.‚",New York Attorney General Sues Trump Foundation After 2-Year Investigation,"June 14, 2018 /  2:53 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-trump-foundation/new-york-sues-trump-and-his-charity-over-self-dealing-idUSKBN1JA26G,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York state attorney general sued U.S. President Donald Trump, three of his children and his foundation on Thursday, saying he illegally used the nonprofit as a personal “checkbook” for his own benefit, including his 2016 presidential campaign. Barbara Underwood, the attorney general, asked a state judge to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation and to ban Trump, his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, and his daughter Ivanka from holding leadership roles in New York charities. The three children joined the foundation’s board in 2006, although Ivanka stepped down to work at the White House in 2017. Underwood said her office’s 21-month investigation, begun under her predecessor Eric Schneiderman, uncovered “extensive unlawful political coordination” by the foundation with Trump’s campaign, as well as “repeated and willful self-dealing” to benefit Trump’s personal, business and political interests. Among the transactions the lawsuit cited as illegal was a $10,000 payment to the Unicorn Children’s Foundation for a portrait of Trump purchased at a fundraising auction in 2014. The portrait would end up decorating a wall at Trump’s Doral golf resort near Miami, the Washington Post reported. Another $100,000 went to another charity in 2007 to settle a legal dispute over a flagpole erected in violation of local ordinances at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club and sometime residence in Palm Beach, Florida.  ""Mr. Trump ran the Foundation according to his whim, rather than the law,"" the lawsuit on.ny.gov/2lbdv0V said.  The lawsuit, filed on Trump’s 72nd birthday in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan, seeks $2.8 million of restitution plus penalties, a 10-year ban on Trump serving as a director of a New York nonprofit, and one-year bans for his children. “As our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,” Underwood said in a statement. “That is not how private foundations should function.”  The foundation had no employees, had never written a required protocol for disbursing funds and its board of directors, which “existed in name only,” had not met since 1999, the lawsuit said.  The Republican president attacked the lawsuit in a series of posts on Twitter that blamed Democratic politicians in his home state. “I won’t settle this case!” Trump wrote, calling the lawsuit ridiculous and engineered by “sleazy New York Democrats.”  During the 2016 presidential race, Trump frequently derided a charity run by the family of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, saying without proof that the former secretary of state  gave favorable treatment to the Clinton Foundation’s wealthy donors.  Related CoverageTrump blasts New York lawsuit: 'I won't settle this case!'Both Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, best known for helping to lower the cost of HIV drugs in the developing world, dismissed those attacks as political mudslinging. The Trump Foundation issued a statement criticizing the latest lawsuit as “politics at its very worst” and accusing the attorney general of holding its $1.7 million in remaining funds “hostage for political gain.” The New York City-based foundation said in a statement it had disbursed more than $19 million to “worthy charitable causes” since its founding in 1987. Trump himself had contributed more than $8 million, and the foundation had already announced its intention to dissolve in 2016, the statement said. FUNDRAISER FOR VETERANS The lawsuit adds to Trump’s legal problems, including an investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. Trump has denied there was any collusion, and Russia has denied meddling in the election. The lawsuit challenges the Trump Foundation’s role in an Iowa fundraiser for military veterans that Trump organized in 2016 instead of taking part in one of the Republican debates.  Some $2.8 million went to the foundation, the lawsuit said, and the foundation wrongly ceded control of those funds to Trump’s campaign staff, who wrongly disbursed grants at campaign rallies for Trump’s political benefit. Tax-exempt nonprofit groups are legally required to avoid partisan politics. The lawsuit said Corey Lewandowski, then Trump’s campaign manager, directed some of the funds to be disbursed in Iowa shortly before its caucuses, where voters from the state gather in the first electoral competition to choose parties’ presidential nominees. Lewandowski, who is not a target of the lawsuit, did not respond to a request for comment. Paul S. Ryan, head of litigation at Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog group in Washington, said the New York filing provides details of actions that could also violate a federal ban on campaigns funneling “soft money” through nonprofits.  “This involvement of the Trump campaign in the foundation’s disbursements right before the Iowa caucuses may very well violate the campaign finance law soft money ban,” Ryan said in an interview.

Comey was ‚insubordinate,‚ but it did not challenge the decision not to charge Mrs. Clinton and did not conclude that bias influenced that choice. The Justice Department‚s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, criticized several aspects of the federal investigation into Mrs. Clinton‚s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Among them were a decision by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to meet former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac; the move by Mr. Comey to publicly say the bureau was recommending no charges while also condemning Mrs. Clinton‚s conduct in detail; and Mr. Comey‚s disclosure that the F.B.I. had reopened the investigation after finding new evidence to examine, and his re-closing of it days before the 2016 presidential election.[Read our coverage on the report.]Mr. Horowitz is also investigating the department‚s handling of the Russia investigation, which President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have sought to portray as scandalous. While several of the same officials were involved in both inquiries, the new report focused only on the Clinton investigation. Here are the highlights that our reporters compiled as they read the report.  Mr. Comey was insubordinate but had no political bias in his decision making in the inquiry, the report found.Mr. Comey made a ‚conscious decision‚ not to tell the Justice Department about holding a news conference in July 2016, according to the report. During the event, Mr. Comey announced that the F.B.I. would not recommend criminal charges in the Clinton investigation. The report found that it was ‚extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so, and we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established department policies in a way intentionally designed to avoid supervision by department leadership over his actions.‚The report makes apparent that Mr. Comey hurt the F.B.I.Mr. Comey has said the decisions he made in 2016 were meant to protect the F.B.I. and shield it from politics. But the inspector general said that Mr. Comey‚s ‚decisions negatively impacted the perception of the F.B.I. and the department as fair administrators of justice.‚‚ Adam GoldmanThe report supports a key rationale behind the decision not to charge Mrs. Clinton.F.B.I. officials recommended no charges against Mrs. Clinton or her aides under a statute that criminalizes ‚gross negligence‚ in handling classified information. That decision turned on an interpretation of the statute that sets a high standard for what a defendant‚s state of mind had to be: The conduct must be ‚so gross as to almost suggest deliberate intention,‚ be ‚criminally reckless‚ or fall ‚just a little short of willful.‚  While the inspector general report does not take a new look at the officials‚ judgment that the evidence in the Clinton case clearly fell short of that standard, it backs their key interpretation of the law, saying it ‚was consistent with the department‚s historical approach in prior cases under different leadership, including in the 2008 decision not to prosecute former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for mishandling classified documents.‚The report adds support for the bottom-line outcome of the email investigation.Mr. Trump and his supporters have repeatedly insinuated that the process was rigged and that a fair investigation would have resulted in charging Mrs. Clinton with a crime ‚ an idea underlying calls for the appointment of a second special counsel to reinvestigate her. But the report‚s endorsement of how investigators interpreted the law undermines that view.‚ Charlie SavageAnother politicized F.B.I. text emerged, as did three more texters.The text was sent by Peter Strzok, a senior F.B.I. official who worked on both the Clinton email server and Russia investigations. Responding to a question by Lisa Page, an F.B.I. lawyer, that Mr. Trump is ‚not ever going to become president, right? Right?!‚ Mr. Strzok responded: ‚No. No he‚s not. We‚ll stop it.‚ The report also says that three other unnamed F.B.I. officials working on the investigation expressed political views, saying their conduct ‚has brought discredit to themselves,‚ undermined confidence in the email investigation and damaged the reputation of the bureau.Republicans could use this fact as new ammunition to portray the F.B.I.‚s investigation of the Trump campaign‚s links to Russia as unfair.The inspector general said it found no evidence that the F.B.I. officials‚ political views had influenced the outcome of the email server case, although the report said it could not be sure whether one decision made by Mr. Strzok ‚ to prioritize the Russia investigation over swiftly following up on the discovery in late September 2016 of possible evidence in the email case ‚ was ‚free from bias.‚ Nevertheless, the report said the officials had damaged the bureau‚s ‚reputation for neutral fact-finding and political independence.‚ That conclusion seems likely to become fodder for fresh accusations of bias by Mr. Trump and his allies who have sought to discredit the Russia investigation by portraying its early stages as scandalous. ‚ Charlie SavageMr. Comey used personal email to conduct F.B.I. business.In a finding drenched with irony, the inspector general report said investigators discovered that three top officials on the inquiry into Mrs. Clinton‚s handling of delicate government information ‚ Mr. Comey, Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page ‚ ‚used their personal email accounts to conduct F.B.I. business.‚ Mr. Comey in particular used it on ‚numerous instances‚ for unclassified business.Democrats could use this fact as new ammunition to portray the F.B.I. investigation into Mrs. Clinton‚s use of a private email server as unfair.Some supporters of Mrs. Clinton have long fumed that the F.B.I.‚s decision to open a criminal inquiry into her use of private email for official business as secretary of state in the first place was unjustified because it is routine for officials to do so ‚ or at least was at the time. The investigation was focused on a handful of emails later deemed to contain classified information. The fact that Mr. Comey and others also sometimes used their personal email accounts for official business underscores their argument. ‚I don‚t know whether to laugh or cry,‚ said Brian Fallon, the former Clinton campaign spokesman.The report also found that Mr. Strzok used his personal email account for government work. The most troubling example came right before the election, the report said, when Mr. Strzok sent an email from his work account to his personal one that included a draft of a search warrant affidavit that was under seal at the time.‚ Charlie Savage and Michael S. SchmidtAndrew G. McCabe‚s recusal was appropriate, the report found, but then he ignored it.Mr. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director, did not have to recuse himself from the bureau‚s Clinton-related investigations, the report concluded after having found ‚no evidence of any financial or business ties between the McCabes and the Clintons.‚ But a Wall Street Journal article about donations to the Virginia State Senate campaign of Mr. McCabe‚s wife, who received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a political committee of a close Clinton ally, created ‚appearance issues‚ for the F.B.I., the report said.  Mr. McCabe recused himself from Clinton-related investigations on Nov. 1, 2016, at the behest of Mr. Comey. But the report found Mr. McCabe then violated his recusal by inquiring about Clinton-related leaks from the F.B.I. to the news media.The report also faulted Peter J. Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for the office of legislative affairs, for not recusing himself. A longtime friend of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton‚s campaign chairman, Mr. Kadzik tried to get his son a job with the Clinton campaign.The bulk of the assessment could help Mr. McCabe repair his reputation, as it shows he followed the rules in his decision to recuse. An earlier inspector general report this year damaged his reputation for finding that he ‚lacked candor‚ with Justice Department officials. Expect Mr. McCabe‚s fight with the inspector general to continue as he works to rehabilitate his image and federal prosecutors continue to investigate whether he lied.‚ Katie BennerThe F.B.I. delayed searching Anthony Weiner‚s laptop by a month.Agents on the Clinton case learned in late September that their counterparts in the New York office had discovered communications on the laptop of Mr. Weiner, then married to a top Clinton aide, that might be relevant to the case. But they waited a month to act, just days before the election, despite knowing ‚virtually every fact‚ they would later use to justify a search of Mr. Weiner‚s laptop, the report found. There was no clear reason for the delay, but the report said that Mr. Strzok told investigators that in the run-up to the election, he was consumed by the Russia inquiry. The report‚s conclusions on the episode ‚ one of the most politically scrutinized of the investigation ‚ gives both Democrats and Republicans new evidence for old lines of argument.The Clinton campaign and its allies have argued that by reactivating the investigation so close to Election Day, the F.B.I. helped sink Mrs. Clinton‚s candidacy.But the report also concluded that given opinions expressed in Mr. Strzok‚s texts, ‚We did not have confidence that Strzok‚s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up‚ on the possible new evidence in the Clinton inquiry was free from bias. Republicans quickly seized on the point to argue that Mr. Strzok may have been pulling punches to help Mrs. Clinton politically. ‚ Nicholas FandosMr. Comey‚s dilemma on the possible new evidence was only in his head, the report found.Mr. Comey has posited that he had no choice but to reveal to Congress that more Clinton emails had been found on Mr. Weiner‚s laptop. But the inspector general said that choice was ‚a false dichotomy‚ and that ‚the doors were actually labeled ‚follow policy/practice‚ and ‚depart from policy/practice.‚‚ He did not find that Mr. Comey‚s myriad fears and beliefs ‚ including the assumption that Mrs. Clinton would win the election and that the information would leak ‚ justified his actions. Much like with his decision in July to say that Mrs. Clinton would not be charged with wrongdoing, the report said the decision to notify Congress was the result of ‚ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding department policy or practice.‚This assessment will be one of the biggest blows to Mr. Comey‚s legacy. It underscores longstanding critiques that he has an outsize belief in his own abilities and ethics, and that his self-regard at times has led him to disregard rules.‚ Katie BennerMr. Comey said Ms. Lynch‚s tarmac meeting with Mr. Clinton prompted a news conference.The inspector general found no evidence that Ms. Lynch discussed the email investigation with Mr. Clinton when he boarded her plane at the Phoenix airport in June 2016. Mr. Comey, who was keenly aware of the meeting‚s optics, told investigators that it had ‚tipped the scales‚ for him in favor of making a public statement about the conclusion of the case ‚ a decision the report sharply criticized. But the report did not spare Ms. Lynch admonishment, either, even if she was not its focus.Investigators concluded that Ms. Lynch‚s ‚failure to recognize the appearance problem created by former President Clinton‚s visit and to take action to cut the visit short was an error in judgment.‚ That failure, and subsequent muddled attempts to explain why she would not recuse herself from the case, provided fodder to Republicans and other Clinton critics who have speculated that Ms. Lynch was working to protect the Clintons from the inside of the Justice Department.‚ Nicholas FandosThe recommendations directly address mistakes made by Mr. Comey, Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page.Mr. Horowitz‚s nine recommendations serve mostly as guardrails against the type of behavior the three engaged in. He recommended that the Justice Department explicitly state that investigators cannot speak publicly about charging decisions without getting approval from senior department officials. It also suggested the department provide guidance about whether agents should take actions that could directly affect an election, including investigative steps, indictments and public announcements. The report said the department needs to make clear that employees have ‚no reasonable expectation of privacy‚ in the use of their government-issued devices.The recommendations are unlikely to be formulated in time for this year‚s midterm elections.With no guidelines in place, expect more political attacks this year about whether F.B.I. and Justice Department actions affect the midterm elections, namely the special counsel inquiry.‚ Katie Benner ",The Report on the F.B.I.‚Äôs Clinton Investigation Is 500 Pages.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein U.S. Congressional committees are also currently investigating the FBI’s handling of the enquiry in 2016. The U.S. Justice Department’s Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, said in a letter that most of the process to sign off on the report and protect classified information it may contain “is now complete, and we anticipate releasing the report on June 14, 2018.”   He also said in the letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley that he will appear at the committee’s June 18 hearing on the FBI’s actions in advance of the 2016 presidential election.  The House of Representatives Judiciary and Oversight Committees also announced on Thursday they will hold a hearing the next day on June 19. The Inspector General’s report will conclude an examination into former FBI Director James Comey’s statements in August 2016 that no charges would be brought against Clinton and his subsequent announcement days before the election that the FBI was re-opening its investigation into her use of a private email server while Secretary of State.  The agency was concerned that Clinton’s use of a non-government computer server may have jeopardized classified information. The report also is expected to address whether active and retired FBI agents in New York leaked information about investigations of the Clinton Foundation charitable organization and the discovery of a trove of Clinton-related emails shortly before the November 2016 election. Law enforcement officials previously told Reuters information about the email trove was leaked to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, an adviser to the Trump campaign who subsequently discussed the contents on Fox News Channel days before Comey informed Congress of the discovery. Horowitz’s office has sought to determine whether the leaks influenced Comey’s decision 11 days before the election to announce the reopening of the Clinton email investigation.

Comey was ‚insubordinate,‚ but it did not challenge the decision not to charge Mrs. Clinton and did not conclude that bias influenced that choice. The Justice Department‚s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, criticized several aspects of the federal investigation into Mrs. Clinton‚s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Among them were a decision by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to meet former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac; the move by Mr. Comey to publicly say the bureau was recommending no charges while also condemning Mrs. Clinton‚s conduct in detail; and Mr. Comey‚s disclosure that the F.B.I. had reopened the investigation after finding new evidence to examine, and his re-closing of it days before the 2016 presidential election.[Read our coverage on the report.]Mr. Horowitz is also investigating the department‚s handling of the Russia investigation, which President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have sought to portray as scandalous. While several of the same officials were involved in both inquiries, the new report focused only on the Clinton investigation. Here are the highlights that our reporters compiled as they read the report.  Mr. Comey was insubordinate but had no political bias in his decision making in the inquiry, the report found.Mr. Comey made a ‚conscious decision‚ not to tell the Justice Department about holding a news conference in July 2016, according to the report. During the event, Mr. Comey announced that the F.B.I. would not recommend criminal charges in the Clinton investigation. The report found that it was ‚extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so, and we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established department policies in a way intentionally designed to avoid supervision by department leadership over his actions.‚The report makes apparent that Mr. Comey hurt the F.B.I.Mr. Comey has said the decisions he made in 2016 were meant to protect the F.B.I. and shield it from politics. But the inspector general said that Mr. Comey‚s ‚decisions negatively impacted the perception of the F.B.I. and the department as fair administrators of justice.‚‚ Adam GoldmanThe report supports a key rationale behind the decision not to charge Mrs. Clinton.F.B.I. officials recommended no charges against Mrs. Clinton or her aides under a statute that criminalizes ‚gross negligence‚ in handling classified information. That decision turned on an interpretation of the statute that sets a high standard for what a defendant‚s state of mind had to be: The conduct must be ‚so gross as to almost suggest deliberate intention,‚ be ‚criminally reckless‚ or fall ‚just a little short of willful.‚  While the inspector general report does not take a new look at the officials‚ judgment that the evidence in the Clinton case clearly fell short of that standard, it backs their key interpretation of the law, saying it ‚was consistent with the department‚s historical approach in prior cases under different leadership, including in the 2008 decision not to prosecute former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for mishandling classified documents.‚The report adds support for the bottom-line outcome of the email investigation.Mr. Trump and his supporters have repeatedly insinuated that the process was rigged and that a fair investigation would have resulted in charging Mrs. Clinton with a crime ‚ an idea underlying calls for the appointment of a second special counsel to reinvestigate her. But the report‚s endorsement of how investigators interpreted the law undermines that view.‚ Charlie SavageAnother politicized F.B.I. text emerged, as did three more texters.The text was sent by Peter Strzok, a senior F.B.I. official who worked on both the Clinton email server and Russia investigations.

Our Experts Broke It Down.,"June 14, 2018 /  5:04 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-fbi/report-rebukes-comey-but-says-no-bias-in-clinton-email-case-idUSKBN1JA0D4,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey made a “serious error of judgment” when he announced shortly before the 2016 U.S. presidential election that he was reopening an investigation into candidate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, the Justice Department’s internal watchdog said on Thursday. But Inspector General Michael Horowitz also concluded in a long-awaited, 500-page report that Comey did not exhibit political bias or try to influence the election; nor did he contest the decision not to charge Clinton with a crime.       A long-serving law enforcement official, Comey became a controversial figure in the 2016 election, drawing accusations from both Republicans and Democrats that his handling of the probe into Clinton’s emails influenced the campaign. Comey later headed a separate investigation into alleged ties between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia. Trump fired him as head of the FBI in May 2017, prompting the appointment of a special counsel now pursuing the Russia probe. Both sides of the partisan divide found something to trumpet in the report. Democrats said it confirmed political bias did not influence the Clinton investigation, while Republicans seized on a newly disclosed text by an FBI agent in mid-2016 expressing his apparent intention to “stop” the Trump campaign. And while embarrassing for the FBI, the report appeared to lack the kind of bombshell revelation that would significantly boost an effort by Trump and his allies to paint the FBI as corrupt and discredit the Russia investigation. FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters at a briefing that he accepted the inspector general’s report, but stressed it did not find that political bias had impacted its investigations.  “The report does identify errors of judgment, violations of, or even disregard for policy and decisions that at the very least, with the benefit of hindsight, were not the best choices,” Wray said. “We need to hold ourselves accountable.” The inspector general’s inquiry focused on public statements made by Comey about Democrat Clinton’s use of a private email server, instead of a State Department server, while she was secretary of state. In October 2016, less than two weeks before Election Day, Comey sent members of Congress a letter disclosing that a probe into Clinton’s emails was being reopened after new emails were discovered, a disclosure Clinton contends contributed to her surprise defeat by Trump. Two days before the Nov. 8 election, Comey said the FBI found no additional evidence in the new emails. John Podesta, who ran the Clinton campaign, told Reuters “the report demonstrates beyond doubt” that Comey was unfair to Clinton by announcing developments concerning the email probe in the heat of the campaign while not revealing the existence of the Russia probe, launched in late July 2016. Comey defended his actions in an op-ed published in the New York Times after the report was released.  “In 2016, my team faced an extraordinary situation — something I thought of as a 500-year flood — offering no good choices and presenting some of the hardest decisions I ever had to make,” Comey wrote. VIOLATING POLICIES    The report sharply criticized Comey for violating Justice     Department policies and accused him of usurping the authority of then Attorney General Loretta Lynch when he held a news conference in July 2016 and announced there was insufficient evidence to charge Clinton with a federal crime over her use of a private server. FBI Director Christopher Wray reacts while discussing the findings of the Inspector General's report on the FBI's handling of a probe into former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, during a news conference in Washington, U.S., June 14, 2018.  REUTERS/Yuri GripasComey said Lynch forced his hand when she did not recuse herself from the Clinton probe, even after a June 2016 meeting with former President Bill Clinton aboard her plane raised concerns she was conflicted. Thursday’s report found that while Lynch did not discuss the email investigation with Bill Clinton, she failed “to recognize the appearance problem” created by the meeting and did not try to cut the meeting short. Lynch in a statement called the report “thorough and in depth” and said it “upholds my fidelity to the rule of law” and “affirms that my actions had no political motivation or bias.” Trump and his allies have accused a clique of FBI and Justice Department officials of working against Trump. The Horowitz report was highly critical of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two FBI staff members who exchanged highly charged political messages, finding their texts cast a cloud over the FBI and created the appearance of bias. In one newly released email from August 2016, Page wrote to Strzok asking “(Trump’s) not ever going to become president, right? Right!” Strzok replied: “No. No he’s not. We’ll stop it.” The report criticized the FBI for a one-month delay between the time new Clinton emails were found on Sept. 26, 2016 and when the FBI finally got a search warrant to review them to search for new evidence in late October as the election loomed. Strzok was among a number of FBI employees who failed to act promptly, the report said. “The FBI’s inaction had potentially far-reaching consequences,” the report says, noting there were no persuasive arguments to explain the delay.  The report added that the inspector general’s office was very concerned about a decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Clinton probe in light of the new emails.  Strzok’s lawyer Aitan Goelman said the report, while flawed in some conclusions, found no evidence that his political views had an impact on the Clinton probe.  Page left the FBI in early May 2018.

25953105,3337,['2018-06-14t16:49:48.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/politics/fbi-inspector-general-comey-trump-clinton-report.html,"WASHINGTON ‚ The Justice Department‚s inspector general on Thursday painted a harsh portrait of the F.B.I. during the 2016 presidential election, describing a destructive culture in which James B. Comey, the former director, was ‚insubordinate,‚ senior officials privately bashed Donald J. Trump and agents came to distrust prosecutors.The 500-page report criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding policy and publicly discussing ‚ in a news conference and a pair of letters in the middle of the campaign ‚ an investigation into Hillary Clinton‚s use of a private email server in handling classified information. The report was a firm rebuke of those actions, which Mr. Comey has tried for months to defend.Nevertheless, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, did not challenge the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton should not be prosecuted. That investigation loomed over most of the presidential campaign, and Mr. Horowitz and his investigators uncovered no proof that political opinions at the F.B.I. influenced its outcome.‚We found no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations,‚ he wrote. ‚Rather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor‚s assessment of facts, the law and past department practice.‚ But the report ‚ initiated in response to a chorus of requests from Congress and the public ‚ was far from an exoneration. Mr. Horowitz was unsparing in his criticism of Mr. Comey and referred five F.B.I. employees for possible discipline over pro-Clinton or anti-Trump commentary in electronic messages. He said agents were far too cozy with journalists. And he described a breakdown in the chain of command, calling it ‚extraordinary‚ that the attorney general acceded to Mr. Comey during the most controversial moments of the Clinton investigation.The result, Mr. Horowitz said, undermined public confidence in the F.B.I. and sowed doubt about the bureau‚s handling of the Clinton investigation, which even two years later remains politically divisive. Mrs. Clinton‚s supporters blame Mr. Comey for her election loss. Mr. Trump believes that Mr. Comey and his agents conspired to clear Mrs. Clinton of wrongdoing because they were openly hostile to his candidacy.Mr. Horowitz repeatedly said he found no evidence that the F.B.I. rigged the outcome. ‚Our review did not find documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages to the specific investigative decisions we reviewed,‚ the report said.The report is especially critical of two F.B.I. officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who exchanged texts disparaging Mr. Trump. Many of those text messages had already been released, but the report cites a previously undisclosed exchange:Mr. Trump is ‚not ever going to become president, right? Right?!‚ Ms. Page wrote.‚No,‚ Mr. Strzok wrote. ‚No he won‚t. We‚ll stop it.‚Ms. Page has left the F.B.I. and Mr. Strzok has been reassigned to human resources. Like other top F.B.I. officials, they were involved in both the Clinton case and the investigation into the Trump campaign‚s ties to Russia. So while the inspector general‚s report focuses entirely on the Clinton case, it has ramifications for the investigation being carried out by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Any evidence of bias or rule-breaking in one case could be used to undermine confidence in the other. Mr. Trump has repeatedly declared the Russia investigation a ‚witch hunt‚ and was eagerly anticipating the release of Thursday‚s report. He was briefed on it but was notably silent about the conclusions.The Republican National Committee, though, distributed talking points to supporters criticizing a ‚fervent anti-Trump bias‚ and calling for Mr. Strzok‚s termination. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, offered few remarks.‚It reaffirmed the president‚s suspicions about Comey‚s conduct and the political bias among some of the members of the F.B.I.,‚ she said. But she referred questions to the current F.B.I. director, Christopher A.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein U.S. Congressional committees are also currently investigating the FBI’s handling of the enquiry in 2016. The U.S. Justice Department’s Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, said in a letter that most of the process to sign off on the report and protect classified information it may contain “is now complete, and we anticipate releasing the report on June 14, 2018.”   He also said in the letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley that he will appear at the committee’s June 18 hearing on the FBI’s actions in advance of the 2016 presidential election.  The House of Representatives Judiciary and Oversight Committees also announced on Thursday they will hold a hearing the next day on June 19. The Inspector General’s report will conclude an examination into former FBI Director James Comey’s statements in August 2016 that no charges would be brought against Clinton and his subsequent announcement days before the election that the FBI was re-opening its investigation into her use of a private email server while Secretary of State.  The agency was concerned that Clinton’s use of a non-government computer server may have jeopardized classified information. The report also is expected to address whether active and retired FBI agents in New York leaked information about investigations of the Clinton Foundation charitable organization and the discovery of a trove of Clinton-related emails shortly before the November 2016 election. Law enforcement officials previously told Reuters information about the email trove was leaked to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, an adviser to the Trump campaign who subsequently discussed the contents on Fox News Channel days before Comey informed Congress of the discovery. Horowitz’s office has sought to determine whether the leaks influenced Comey’s decision 11 days before the election to announce the reopening of the Clinton email investigation.

Comey, the former director, was ‚insubordinate,‚ senior officials privately bashed Donald J. Trump and agents came to distrust prosecutors.The 500-page report criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding policy and publicly discussing ‚ in a news conference and a pair of letters in the middle of the campaign ‚ an investigation into Hillary Clinton‚s use of a private email server in handling classified information. The report was a firm rebuke of those actions, which Mr. Comey has tried for months to defend.Nevertheless, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, did not challenge the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton should not be prosecuted. That investigation loomed over most of the presidential campaign, and Mr. Horowitz and his investigators uncovered no proof that political opinions at the F.B.I. influenced its outcome.‚We found no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations,‚ he wrote. ‚Rather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor‚s assessment of facts, the law and past department practice.‚ But the report ‚ initiated in response to a chorus of requests from Congress and the public ‚ was far from an exoneration. Mr. Horowitz was unsparing in his criticism of Mr. Comey and referred five F.B.I. employees for possible discipline over pro-Clinton or anti-Trump commentary in electronic messages. He said agents were far too cozy with journalists. And he described a breakdown in the chain of command, calling it ‚extraordinary‚ that the attorney general acceded to Mr. Comey during the most controversial moments of the Clinton investigation.The result, Mr. Horowitz said, undermined public confidence in the F.B.I. and sowed doubt about the bureau‚s handling of the Clinton investigation, which even two years later remains politically divisive.

But Inspector General Michael Horowitz also concluded in a long-awaited, 500-page report that Comey did not exhibit political bias or try to influence the election; nor did he contest the decision not to charge Clinton with a crime.       A long-serving law enforcement official, Comey became a controversial figure in the 2016 election, drawing accusations from both Republicans and Democrats that his handling of the probe into Clinton’s emails influenced the campaign. Comey later headed a separate investigation into alleged ties between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia. Trump fired him as head of the FBI in May 2017, prompting the appointment of a special counsel now pursuing the Russia probe. Both sides of the partisan divide found something to trumpet in the report. Democrats said it confirmed political bias did not influence the Clinton investigation, while Republicans seized on a newly disclosed text by an FBI agent in mid-2016 expressing his apparent intention to “stop” the Trump campaign. And while embarrassing for the FBI, the report appeared to lack the kind of bombshell revelation that would significantly boost an effort by Trump and his allies to paint the FBI as corrupt and discredit the Russia investigation. FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters at a briefing that he accepted the inspector general’s report, but stressed it did not find that political bias had impacted its investigations.  “The report does identify errors of judgment, violations of, or even disregard for policy and decisions that at the very least, with the benefit of hindsight, were not the best choices,” Wray said. “We need to hold ourselves accountable.” The inspector general’s inquiry focused on public statements made by Comey about Democrat Clinton’s use of a private email server, instead of a State Department server, while she was secretary of state. In October 2016, less than two weeks before Election Day, Comey sent members of Congress a letter disclosing that a probe into Clinton’s emails was being reopened after new emails were discovered, a disclosure Clinton contends contributed to her surprise defeat by Trump. Two days before the Nov. 8 election, Comey said the FBI found no additional evidence in the new emails. John Podesta, who ran the Clinton campaign, told Reuters “the report demonstrates beyond doubt” that Comey was unfair to Clinton by announcing developments concerning the email probe in the heat of the campaign while not revealing the existence of the Russia probe, launched in late July 2016. Comey defended his actions in an op-ed published in the New York Times after the report was released.  “In 2016, my team faced an extraordinary situation — something I thought of as a 500-year flood — offering no good choices and presenting some of the hardest decisions I ever had to make,” Comey wrote. VIOLATING POLICIES    The report sharply criticized Comey for violating Justice     Department policies and accused him of usurping the authority of then Attorney General Loretta Lynch when he held a news conference in July 2016 and announced there was insufficient evidence to charge Clinton with a federal crime over her use of a private server.

REUTERS/Yuri GripasComey said Lynch forced his hand when she did not recuse herself from the Clinton probe, even after a June 2016 meeting with former President Bill Clinton aboard her plane raised concerns she was conflicted. Thursday’s report found that while Lynch did not discuss the email investigation with Bill Clinton, she failed “to recognize the appearance problem” created by the meeting and did not try to cut the meeting short. Lynch in a statement called the report “thorough and in depth” and said it “upholds my fidelity to the rule of law” and “affirms that my actions had no political motivation or bias.” Trump and his allies have accused a clique of FBI and Justice Department officials of working against Trump. The Horowitz report was highly critical of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two FBI staff members who exchanged highly charged political messages, finding their texts cast a cloud over the FBI and created the appearance of bias. In one newly released email from August 2016, Page wrote to Strzok asking “(Trump’s) not ever going to become president, right? Right!” Strzok replied: “No. No he’s not. We’ll stop it.” The report criticized the FBI for a one-month delay between the time new Clinton emails were found on Sept. 26, 2016 and when the FBI finally got a search warrant to review them to search for new evidence in late October as the election loomed. Strzok was among a number of FBI employees who failed to act promptly, the report said. “The FBI’s inaction had potentially far-reaching consequences,” the report says, noting there were no persuasive arguments to explain the delay.  The report added that the inspector general’s office was very concerned about a decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Clinton probe in light of the new emails.  Strzok’s lawyer Aitan Goelman said the report, while flawed in some conclusions, found no evidence that his political views had an impact on the Clinton probe.  Page left the FBI in early May 2018.

26604205,3369,['2018-06-14t16:07:49.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/politics/supreme-court-minnesota-polling-places-politics.html,"WASHINGTON ‚ The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a Minnesota law that prohibits voters from wearing T-shirts, hats and buttons expressing political views at polling places.In a cautious 7-to-2 decision, the court acknowledged the value of decorum and solemn deliberation as voters prepare to cast their ballots. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that Minnesota‚s law was not ‚capable of reasoned application.‚Minnesota‚s law, similar to ones in about nine other states, is quite broad. It says that ‚a political badge, political button or other political insignia may not be worn at or about a polling place on primary or Election Day.‚As enforced by election officials, the law bans even general political messages on apparel, like support for gun rights or labor unions. The goal, state officials have said, is ‚an orderly and controlled environment without confusion, interference or distraction.‚The case started when members of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, which says it works to ensure ‚election integrity,‚ turned up at Minnesota polling places wearing T-shirts bearing Tea Party logos and buttons saying ‚Please I.D. Me.‚They were told to cover the messages and were allowed to vote even if they refused. But they risked prosecution for disobeying poll workers‚ orders.The group and two individuals challenged the law on free speech grounds, and they lost in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis.‚Even if Tea Party apparel is not election-related, it is not unreasonable to prohibit it in a polling place,‚ Judge Duane Benton wrote. ‚In order to ensure a neutral, influence-free polling place, all political material is banned.‚ Chief Justice Roberts said that went too far. States remain free to decide that ‚some forms of advocacy should be excluded from the polling place,‚ he wrote. He cited with seeming approval more focused laws in California and Texas aimed at classic electioneering.‚Casting a vote is a weighty civic act, akin to a jury‚s return of a verdict, or a representative‚s vote on a piece of legislation,‚ the chief justice wrote. ‚It is a time for choosing, not campaigning. The state may reasonably decide that the interior of the polling place should reflect that distinction.‚But Minnesota, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, had failed to ‚articulate some sensible basis for distinguishing what may come in from what must stay out.‚There is no problem with banning items supporting or opposing candidates or ballot measures, he indicated. But Minnesota also barred materials ‚designed to influence or impact voting,‚ which officials interpreted to cover messages touching on any subject that had been addressed by candidates and their parties.‚A rule whose fair enforcement requires an election judge to maintain a mental index of the platforms and positions of every candidate and party on the ballot is not reasonable,‚ Chief Justice Roberts wrote.The state also barred apparel and insignia that promoted groups with political views. Chief Justice Roberts said that could cover the American Civil Liberties Union, AARP, the World Wildlife Fund, Ben & Jerry‚s and the Boy Scouts.When the case was argued in February, a lawyer for the state was peppered with questions about what was and was not allowed. His answers, Chief Justice Roberts suggested, betrayed no consistent theme. The law would bar T-shirts saying ‚All Lives Matter,‚ promoting the National Rifle Association or displaying the text of the Second Amendment, said the lawyer, Daniel Rogan. A T-shirt bearing a rainbow flag ‚would be permitted,‚ he said, ‚unless there was an issue on the ballot that related somehow to gay rights.‚ And a T-shirt saying ‚Parkland Strong,‚ referring to the Florida school shooting, or displaying the text of the First Amendment would be allowed, Mr. Rogan said.All of this, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, meant that Minnesota‚s approach ‚poses riddles that even the state‚s top lawyers struggle to solve.‚States can give ‚the voter the opportunity to exercise his civic duty in a setting removed from the clamor and din of electioneering,‚ Chief Justice Roberts concluded. ‚While that choice is generally worthy of our respect, Minnesota has not supported its good intentions with a law capable of reasoned application.‚In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, said the court should have asked the Minnesota Supreme Court for a definitive interpretation of the state law.In a 1992 decision, Burson v. Freeman, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law that created a 100-foot buffer zone around polling places barring electioneering. But that law was aimed at traditional campaign signs and posters, not apparel bearing more general messages.Thursday‚s decision in Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, No. 16-1435, said nothing that would undermine such buffer zones.",Supreme Court Strikes Down Law Barring Political Apparel at Polling Places,"June 14, 2018 /  2:30 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-apparel/supreme-court-throws-out-minnesota-ban-on-voter-political-apparel-idUSKBN1JA23A,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - States cannot impose a blanket prohibition on apparel such as T-shirts and buttons bearing political messages in polling sites, the U.S. Supreme Court said on Thursday in an important free speech ruling striking down a Minnesota law as unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court is seen as the court nears the end of its term in Washington, U.S., June 11, 2018. REUTERS/Erin SchaffThe court ruled 7-2 that Minnesota’s law, which dates back to 1912 and was intended to maintain decorum at polling sites, went too far in banning voters from wearing political apparel - without even defining what is meant by “political.” But the justices left room for states to craft some sort of limits on what should be allowed in polling places and what should not. Minnesota’s law barred people from wearing clothing, badges, buttons or other insignia with overtly political messages inside polling places during primary or general elections. In a ruling issued against a backdrop of deepening political polarization in America, the Supreme Court endorsed the argument advanced by the conservative activists who challenged the law in 2010, finding that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts said because Minnesota’s law did not define the term “political” the measure could be haphazardly enforced at polling sites. He wondered in the ruling whether a “Support Our Troops” shirt could be banned, or one displaying “#MeToo,” referring to a movement encouraging women to share their experiences of abuse. Minnesota had argued that the law was applied neutrally and helped prevent confusion or intimidation at polling places. While Minnesota had tried to promote voting “in a setting removed from the clamor and din of electioneering,” Roberts wrote, the state “has not supported its good intentions with a law capable of reasoned application.” Still, Roberts said, states can prohibit certain apparel at polling places to avoid the partisan discord that can be associated with an election. Roberts was joined by the court’s four other conservatives as well as liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. Liberals Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer dissented. ‘ARBITERS OF FREE SPEECH’ “The court put all government entities on notice - they cannot dictate the terms of personal expression, nor can they designate the arbiters of free speech at their whim,” said attorney David Breemer of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which represented the law’s challengers.  By protecting speech in a sensitive place like a polling site, the group said, the ruling safeguards expression in other forums as well such as airports, town halls and college campuses. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said he was gratified that the court recognized “the vital interest of maintaining an ‘island of calm’ in our polling places.” “The (Minnesota) legislature now must change Minnesota law so that it is entirely consistent with the right of free speech and expression - while also maintaining the sanctity of the polling place,” Simon added. Delaware, Kansas, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and South Carolina impose restrictions similar to Minnesota’s. In another major ruling involving free speech at polling sites, the high court in 1992 upheld a Tennessee law barring the solicitation of votes and the display or distribution of campaign material within 100 feet (30 meters) of a polling place. One of the conservative activists who challenged the law, Andy Cilek of the St. Paul-based Minnesota Voters Alliance, was stopped by a poll worker when he showed up on Election Day in 2010 wearing a T-shirt touting the conservative Tea Party movement with the words “Don’t Tread on Me” as well as a button stating, “Please I.D. Me.” Cilek eventually was allowed to vote. Violators were asked to cover up or remove offending items, and officials were instructed not to bar anyone from voting. Minnesota had no record of any prosecutions under the law. After the ruling, Cilek said that “we showed that our right to free speech doesn’t stop at the polling place.” Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will DunhamOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Supreme Court throws out Minnesota ban on voter political apparel,W

Their victory in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, had appeared uncertain for weeks. During the final hours of the debate, which lasted more than 22 hours, opponents of the measure appeared to have a slim lead. That changed early Thursday when a handful of representatives switched their position. If the upper chamber, the Senate, approves the measure, Argentina would become the most populous country in Latin America to legalize abortion. That would be a remarkable milestone in a region where strict abortion laws are the norm.‚It seemed unthinkable only a few months ago,‚ said Emilce Fern√°ndez, 53, a psychologist who watched the vote with her 26-year-old daughter on a large television screen installed outside Congress. ‚It shows the power of public pressure.‚ Pope Francis, who is Argentine, had urged his home country to leave current restrictions in place, issuing a letter in March pleading for the ‚defense of life and justice.‚ Current law allows abortions under very limited circumstances, including in cases of rape or when a mother‚s life is in danger. Supporters of the bill have feared that it will be derailed in the Senate, which is regarded as the more conservative chamber. But Senate leaders on Thursday suggested that the legislation could get a favorable vote within weeks.‚I think this issue is unstoppable,‚ Senator Miguel √Ångel Pichetto, the leader of the largest opposition bloc, said in a statement. ‚We have to understand the changes that take place in society, and as a result recognize and legislate these new rights.‚ The bloc that includes former President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner ‚ who won a Senate seat last year ‚ also announced Thursday that it intended to support the bill ‚responding to the social demand that has been conveyed by massive collectives of women.‚As president, Ms. Kirchner had opposed legalizing abortion.Senator Luis Naidenoff, who leads President Mauricio Macri‚s coalition in the chamber, said his ‚intuition tells me‚ that the chamber would pass the bill with the same patchwork alliance that won in the lower house.The effort to change Argentina‚s abortion laws gained traction in recent months as a spinoff of a movement that began in 2015 to raise awareness about violence against women. Proponents of the bill got a lift early this year when Mr. Macri ‚ who opposes legalizing abortion ‚ told allied lawmakers that they should vote their conscience. Juan Cruz D√≠az, an analyst in Buenos Aires, said the size and intensity of the demonstrations had reminded him of the movement to legalize same-sex marriage, which prevailed in 2010.‚Argentina has shown throughout the decades that social mobilizations can have a direct impact on Congress,‚ he said.Still, passage of the bill in the Senate is far from a sure thing. A count by Econom√≠a Feminista, which advocates gender equality, notes that only 19 senators have publicly signaled support for legalizing abortion, while 30 have said they oppose the measure and 23 remain undecided. Opponents of the measure, who were significantly outnumbered outside Congress, carried out a live sonogram on a pregnant woman in the hours before the vote was held.‚I got goose bumps and tears in my eyes,‚ said Mar√≠a Agustina Sosa, a 27-year-old industrial engineer. ‚I wish those inside the chamber could have seen that ‚ there‚s no way they could say that‚s not a life.‚After the vote, Vanina Garc√≠a, a 39-year-old teacher, was crying as she celebrated and hugged her friends about a block from Congress.‚I have this indescribable sense of freedom,‚ she said.",Bid to Legalize Abortion in Argentina Clears First Hurdle in Congress,"June 14, 2018 /  2:02 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-abortion/argentina-lower-house-passes-legal-abortion-bill-in-tight-vote-idUSKBN1JA1ZT,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The lower house of Argentina’s Congress on Thursday narrowly passed a bill to legalize abortion through 14 weeks of pregnancy after a tight vote on a proposal that has divided the South American nation.

It passed the house with 129 votes in favor and 125 against after an all-night debate. “We are dealing with a public health issue that cannot be addressed with blinders, nor with morals and ethics and much less religion,” opposition congresswoman Mayra Mendoza, one of the driving forces of the proposal, said in a speech. “This is also a matter of social justice.” Slideshow (4 Images)The opposition, as well as allies of President Mauricio Macri, were divided on the issue. Macri has encouraged his party members to vote as they see fit even though he is personally opposed to the proposal.  Argentina, like most countries in Latin America, currently permits abortion in specific cases, including rape and risk to the mother’s life. Rights groups have criticized a requirement for a judge’s permission, which often results in lengthy delays or denial of the procedure.

He was ‚beaten over the head and dragged into the back of a police truck,‚ after the authorities moved to quash the demonstrations that day, according to the statement.A video from the protests shows Mr. Nguyen, with blood smeared across his face, being dragged by a group of men. He is later shown standing in the bed of a pickup truck topped with emergency lights. He was taken to a police station, but his current whereabouts and physical condition are not known, the statement said.Mr. Nguyen‚s family fled South Vietnam after the war that led to its collapse, he wrote in a recent piece for the website New Naratif that discussed the conflict and the country‚s history of divisions between North and South.‚He is a proud Vietnamese-American, and passionate about his studies, specifically Southeast Asian studies, in which he majored,‚ his sister, Victoria Nguyen, said by email.Pope Thrower, spokesman for the United States Embassy in Hanoi, said the embassy was ‚aware of media reports that a U.S. citizen was arrested in Vietnam.‚ImageWill Nguyen, 32, of Houston, has been studying at the University of Singapore.CreditNguyen family ‚When a U.S. citizen is detained overseas, the U.S. Department of State works to provide all appropriate consular assistance,‚ he added. ‚Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.‚ From Ho Chi Minh City, commonly called Saigon, Mr. Nguyen posted a series of tweets documenting the protests on Sunday, with crowds of people marching down city streets.‚I can‚t stress how enormous of an achievement this is for the #Vietnamese people,‚ he wrote. ‚The communist government is allowing people to assemble peacefully and the people are exercising their civic duty to protest injustice.‚One image he posted shows a protester who was struck by police officers lying on the street while another person helps him. Mr. Nguyen‚s family has not been able to reach him, but his hosts at an Airbnb rental did reportedly speak with him shortly after his detention. Police officers showed up at the apartment two days later to confiscate his laptop, passport and credit cards, and a change of clothes, his family said.In addition to the special economic zones, protesters said they were concerned about a proposed cybersecurity law. The state-controlled news media in Vietnam reported that 102 people were arrested Sunday in the southeastern province of Binh Thuan, where thousands of protesters blocked a highway and later set fire to public buildings. Protests were also reported in Hanoi, the capital. The proposed special economic zones would give leases of up to 99 years to foreign investors in three areas that would have fewer administrative restrictions than the rest of the country. The proposal has stirred fear that it would undermine national security by giving China control over parts of Vietnamese territory.Vietnam and China have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, and Chinese efforts to extend control have set off protests in Vietnam. In 2014, China moved an offshore drilling rig into waters that Vietnam considers part of its exclusive economic zone, which prompted large demonstrations and efforts by Vietnam to force the rig to move.The two countries fought a brief but bloody border war in 1979, when China invaded Vietnam in an attempt to punish its neighbor for toppling the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.",American Is Detained After Joining Protest in Vietnam,"June 11, 2018 /  7:27 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-protests/china-warns-citizens-in-vietnam-after-protests-over-economic-zones-idUSKBN1J70NS,"HANOI (Reuters) - China has warned its citizens in Vietnam after protesters clashed with police over a government plan to create new economic zones for foreign investment that has fueled anti-Chinese sentiment in the country.

REUTERS/StaffMore than 100 protesters were arrested and dozens of police injured at a protest in central Vietnam on Sunday, one of several demonstrations nationwide against the special economic zones opponents fear will be dominated by Chinese investors. The Chinese embassy in Hanoi posted a notice on its website referring to the protests as “illegal gatherings” that had included some “anti-China content”. “The Chinese embassy in Vietnam is paying close attention to the relevant developments and reminds Chinese citizens in Vietnam to pay attention to security when traveling,” the notice said. Vietnam’s National Assembly agreed on Monday to delay a vote on the draft bill, which would allow foreign investors to lease land for up to 99 years and provide greater incentives and fewer restrictions than at present in the country. Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, chairwoman of the Assembly, said the protesters might have misunderstood the nature of the bill.  “People should stay calm, believe in the decisions of the party and the state, especially in the fact that the National Assembly is always listening to the people’s opinions when discussing the bills,” Ngan said. Public protests are not rare in Vietnam and are often quickly quelled by the police. On Sunday, protesters in the central province of Binh Thuan threw petrol bombs and bricks at police and damaged local government offices and vehicles, state media reported.

In the capital Hanoi, police detained more than a dozen protesters who marched down a busy street, some carrying anti-Chinese banners including one that said “No leasing land to China even for one day”. Activists said several protesters were also detained in the country’s economic hub, Ho Chi Minh City. The government has said the bill aims to boost development in three provinces in northern, central and southern Vietnam and provide “room for institutional experiments”. The initial draft law said land in the zones could be leased for up to 99 years, but Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told local media last week the term would be reduced, although he did not say by how much. The protests come at a time of rising tensions over the disputed South China Sea, nearly all of which is claimed by China. Vietnam is among several countries in the region that have claims in the South China Sea, through which an estimated $5 trillion in trade passes each year. Some of the protesters at Sunday’s demonstrations were also protesting against another draft bill on cybersecurity amid widespread concern the law would cause economic harm and stifle online dissent in the communist-ruled country.  The United States and Canada urged Vietnam on Friday to delay the vote on the proposed cybersecurity law. The National Assembly is scheduled to vote on it on Tuesday.

The executives under Mr. Martin, including CNN‚s Jeff Zucker, will report directly to Mr. Stankey, as will the HBO chief Richard Plepler and the Warner Bros. head Kevin Tsujihara. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, will be a senior adviser during a transition period and then retire.The Time Warner name will also be retired and the company will be rechristened WarnerMedia. In addition, ‚many of the redundant corporate support functions‚ will be eliminated, according to the note. AT&T estimates cost savings of about $2.5 billion over the next few years. In an interview, Mr. Stankey spoke about his early plans for the media conglomerate. The following has been edited for length and clarity.You are currently on a tour meeting Time Warner executives. Are you still in New York?I left early this morning. I‚m now in Atlanta.And now I‚ve had an opportunity to meet with a number of folks. Obviously, the team is large. I haven‚t gotten to everybody yet. That‚s one reason why I‚m in Atlanta. There are questions and concerns about the culture fit between the two companies. Everything from expense perks to pricey pay packages, an expectation in the entertainment industry. How do you plan to manage that? I‚m well aware there‚s some differences between the two businesses‚ cultures, and my boss is well aware that there‚s differences, and we‚re being deliberate in how we‚re choosing to set up the organization and manage it. My job is to ensure those cultural differences are a nonissue. And so it would be a silly thing for me to do to walk in and try to suggest that there‚s a one-size-fits-all approach to two businesses that are in two different industries that grew up differently that have different sets of expectations. And I think we‚re probably savvy enough individuals and experienced enough business professionals that we know how to strike the balance on that. And that‚s my job. And if I don‚t do that job well I won‚t be here very long.Owning a media business often comes with having to manage politically sensitive content. Samantha Bee and Bill Maher are examples of talent whose shows have irked some audiences. Will they be given the same freedom they‚re used to getting now?People who are running the creative process are professionals at running the creative process. I don‚t believe that AT&T ‚ the historical AT&T ‚ by its nature brings much capability or intellectual property to do that better.The question is, are we going to have a different attitude or approach to it? The answer is, probably not. I will give you an example. I know what went down a few weeks ago. I‚ve obviously taken particular note of it. We‚ve asked ourselves during those events, ‚What would we be doing?‚ And when I compare notes with my companions at Time Warner, it‚s surprising how close we are in our points of view and how we would choose to go about managing these things.It sounds like you were referring to the Samantha Bee incident last month where she used a vulgarity to describe Ivanka Trump on her TBS show. She eventually apologized, as did the network. Was that handled in the right way? I think they handled it very well.At the end of the day, we‚re going to be just fine. And rather than dwell on what might be, I think the important thing to do is watch how we handle those things when the eventual events occur. And they will occur, and we‚re well aware that we need to be savvy about how we do that.What about CNN? The president has called out the network on an almost daily basis as the enemy. Well, first of all the folks at CNN will continue to do what they do without my involvement or intervention. I think they do that incredibly very well, and they will continue to do that under my leadership just like they did the day before I showed up here. My job is to make sure I work with them on giving them the resources and the capabilities to not only do what they‚ve done well but find ways to distribute the information and the education they deliver to the population more broadly. Have you met with Jeff Zucker, the head of CNN? Yes, and I‚m very excited that Jeff has agreed he‚s going to spend time with me and teach me the things that I didn‚t grow up with and get me deeper in some of the knowledge of how media and the news cycles work. And I‚m really anxious to get involved with that. I think we‚re going to have a great working relationship.What about investment? HBO spends about $2.5 billion, for example, to Netflix‚s $8 billion. Hulu already spends about $2.5 billion annually. Does AT&T plan to invest more in HBO? I think HBO is a tremendous brand. I think they‚ve done a phenomenal job. What I‚ve learned about it during the pendency of this transaction, I think they‚ve got a funnel and an opportunity to do even more. And I‚m very excited personally about opening up those opportunities for them to pursue it and build more audience and more engagement. Because at the end of the day, we want our technology and we want our content to drive more customer engagement. If we have the opportunity to do that by investing we are going to invest to make that happen.Does that mean more streaming services from HBO?Whether it‚s HBO or Turner or CNN or any other assets, over time you have to have direct relationship with the consumer where you can gauge how many minutes, or how many hours, you‚re getting with that end user. And that is the North Star we‚re following here.I think the dynamic is: How do you get more engagement with the customer where you own a degree of that relationship, and you understand what the customer is doing, and you have the benefit of the data they bring to that equation? And you drive that engagement by putting more and engaging content in front of them.And it sounds like you plan to use data as a way to inform programming decisions at Turner and HBO?Nothing replaces the creative process, and having the best creative minds and the best ideas.But data can inform issues like, how do you bundle and aggregate content? Who and how do you choose to distribute it to? How do you find monetization models where maybe instead of charging the customer directly through subscriptions or increasing rates, you can do it through advertising monetization? How do you learn about what kind of content customers are more passionate about that they burn through faster and therefore you want to start the right kind of relationships with creative talent that can build that kind of content? Data can help you be better, but it doesn‚t replace a creative process and the value of creative assets.",AT&T Executive Taking Over HBO and CNN Promises a Hands-Off Approach,"June 18, 2018 /  8:12 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-stankey/att-promises-fewer-ads-tailored-programing-after-merger-idUSKBN1JE2NO,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) is promising fewer commercials, smaller channel bundles and personalized programming now that it has taken over Time Warner channels in an $85 billion mega-merger.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid After overcoming the U.S. Justice Department’s objection that the deal would harm competition, AT&T, the country’s number two wireless operator, said it will use its technology to reinvent how consumers receive and view entertainment. A major aim is to reduce the number of commercials now that customers are accustomed to ad-free services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), said John Stankey, chief executive of newly named AT&T unit WarnerMedia. “One of the big benefits we can bring to the market is lighter ad loads,” Stankey told Reuters in an interview. AT&T, long dominant in the U.S. telephone industry, is now at the forefront of Hollywood with its purchase of Time Warner, which owned HBO, the Warner Brothers film and television studios, and Turner Broadcasting and CNN. AT&T plans to use mobile phone and video data, supplied by customers who have given permission, to sell targeted advertisements. The thinking is that brands will pay more if they know their message is reaching someone likely to be interested in it.  For example, “if I’m a beer drinker, I’m more interested in seeing things about beer than soft drinks,” Stankey said. Some of Time Warner’s Turner networks already have cut the number of commercials. Comedy network TruTV, for example, has reduced ad time by roughly 50 percent. AT&T “absolutely” should be able to further reduce ad inventory across Turner networks, Stankey said. AUTOMATED MARKETPLACE The company will start selling targeted ads for Turner networks such as TNT and CNN “in short order,” Stankey said.  An industry-wide, automated marketplace, which would sell ads across other companies’ channels, would require cooperation across multiple players, and Stankey acknowledged that remains “easily a year off.” The Justice Department and other critics had argued that AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner would harm consumers by limiting competition and leading to price increases. But a U.S. judge disagreed, and AT&T completed the merger last week. The government still may appeal. AT&T now owns popular properties such as “Game of Thrones” along with the Harry Potter and Wonder Woman franchises. In the coming days, it will launch AT&T Watch, a package of Turner networks plus some from other media companies, Stankey said.  Designed as a general entertainment package that is smaller than traditional cable bundles, AT&T Watch will not carry sports-specific networks, Stankey said.  AT&T also plans to tailor programing to customer interests, such as by sending CNN news clips to mobile phone users based on their interests, or alerts about types of programing they might like based on earlier viewing, Stankey said. Customers of HBO’s online services should not expect any immediate change to the company’s stance on password sharing, Stankey said. HBO limits the number of simultaneous streams but has accepted that some password sharing will occur. AT&T is comfortable with password sharing among family members and believes most cases occur among people with a close relationship to someone who pays for the service, Stankey said.  “If somebody becomes really passionate about doing something through password sharing, and at some point they get hooked on it, they move into being a paying subscriber,” he said.

The attack was fueled by irritation over a pile of debris.The neighbor, Rene A. Boucher, 60, of Bowling Green, Ky., was also sentenced to one year of probation and a $10,000 fine, said Tim Horty, a spokesman for the United States attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, in a phone interview.In a statement, Mr. Paul said that he believed a conviction with prison time was ‚appropriate,‚ and he hoped it would deter Mr. Boucher from any future violence.‚No one deserves to be violently assaulted,‚ Mr. Paul said. ‚I commend the F.B.I. and Department of Justice for treating this violent, premeditated assault with the seriousness it deserves.‚ ‚He is very relieved to have this last phase of the court proceedings over with,‚ said Matthew J. Baker, a lawyer for Mr. Boucher. ‚He‚s very much looking forward to getting this over with once and for all.‚Mr. Baker said the defense had no plans to appeal the sentence.The attack in November left Mr. Paul with several broken ribs and precipitated a case of pneumonia. It kept him out of Washington for nearly two weeks while lawmakers debated the Republican tax bill, his spokesman said.Mr. Boucher, a retired anesthesiologist, pleaded guilty to a felony count of assaulting a member of Congress resulting in a personal injury, a charge that carries a maximum term of 10 years in prison. Prosecutors had been seeking 21 months of jail time for Mr. Boucher. ‚Assaulting a member of Congress is an offense we take very seriously,‚ Josh J. Minkler, the United States attorney who handled the case, said in a news release. ‚Those who choose to violate the law will be aggressively prosecuted in federal court.‚ On Nov. 3, the day of the altercation, Mr. Paul was mowing his lawn in Bowling Green while wearing headphones when Mr. Boucher ran over and tackled the lawmaker, according to a news release from federal prosecutors. The neighbor said he had ‚had enough‚ after watching Mr. Paul stack a pile of brush near the property line between their two yards, the release said.Mr. Baker said in an interview earlier this week that Mr. Paul‚s tendency to pile brush near his neighbor‚s property had been a consistent irritant to his client. The day before the attack, Mr. Baker said, Mr. Boucher had decided to burn a pile of brush placed near his land ‚ suffering second-degree burns in the process. The Bowling Green Daily News first reported these details regarding the lead-up to the attack.‚This issue had been festering for several months,‚ Mr. Baker said in an interview. ‚Unfortunately it ended the way it did.‚Mr. Baker said his client, a registered Democrat, had no political motives for attacking Mr. Paul, a Republican. The defense had pushed for a sentence without jail time, citing a lack of prior criminal charges. Mr. Baker said that Mr. Boucher was ‚deeply remorseful‚ over the incident.Mr. Paul‚s aides have disputed the defense‚s characterization that the lawmaker and his neighbor had a longstanding conflict over their yards, calling the attack a ‚premeditated assault.‚‚Any description of this attack that implies a ‚yard dispute‚ justifies such violence and misses the point,‚ Sergio Gor, a spokesman for Mr. Paul, said in a statement earlier this week. He said Mr. Paul had no contact with his neighbor in the decade before the assault.Mr. Boucher‚s case was transferred to a United States attorney‚s office in the Southern District of Indiana after federal prosecutors originally assigned to prosecute the case in Kentucky were recused.A misdemeanor assault charge filed against Mr. Boucher in a state court in Kentucky was dismissed after he pleaded guilty to the federal charge, said Mr. Horty, the Indiana district spokesman.",Rand Paul‚Äôs Neighbor Is Sentenced to 30 Days in Prison After Attack,"June 15, 2018 /  8:51 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kentucky-politics-assault/kentucky-man-gets-30-day-sentence-in-attack-on-senator-rand-paul-idUSKBN1JB2WR,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday sentenced a Kentucky man to 30 days in prison for assaulting U.S. Senator Rand Paul in an attack last November that left the politician with several broken ribs, prosecutors said.  Rene Boucher, 60, of Bowling Green, Kentucky, must also serve one year of supervised release following his prison stay and pay a $10,000 fine, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana said in a statement.  During the period of supervised release, Boucher will also be ordered to serve 100 hours of community service, Boucher’s attorney Matt Baker said. Boucher was not taken into custody on Friday and within the next several weeks will be given a date to surrender himself to authorities. In court on Friday, Boucher expressed remorse and apologized to the Paul family, Baker said. “As he told the court, there isn’t a day, an hour, that goes by that he doesn’t think about it. So again, he’s just very relieved to have this phase of it behind him,” Baker said.  Paul said the original 21-month sentence requested would have been the appropriate punishment and praised the FBI and Justice Department for their handling of the case. “No one deserves to be violently assaulted,” the senator said in a statement. “A felony conviction is appropriate and hopefully will deter the attacker from further violence.” On Nov. 3, Paul was mowing his yard wearing headphones when Boucher claimed Paul stacked brush onto a pile near the victim’s property, prosecutors said. Boucher, a physician like Paul, ran onto Paul’s property and tackled him. Paul suffered multiple fractured ribs and subsequently contracted pneumonia, prosecutors said. On three occasions before the attack, Boucher had cleaned up yard debris placed on the line between the two men’s properties, Baker said in a telephone interview. On Nov. 3, it appeared to Boucher that a fresh pile of yard debris was being reconstructed “and Dr. Boucher lost his temper momentarily,” Baker said. Boucher, who pleaded guilty in March, admitted assaulting the Republican senator, but denied it was politically motivated, prosecutors said. Local charges were dismissed in lieu of the federal felony charge, said Tim Horty, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana. The Indiana office prosecuted the case following the recusal of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Kentucky, where the crime occurred. U.S. District Judge Marianne Battani from the Eastern District of Michigan sentenced Boucher in federal court in Kentucky.

Kevin Chmielewski, who was Mr. Pruitt‚s deputy chief of staff for operations until February, recalled a conversation last year when Mr. Pruitt instructed him and other top aides to ‚see what you can do‚ about getting the internship, a highly competitive and prized post in Washington. Ms. Pruitt was selected as an intern last summer.‚We were constantly fielding requests like this, even though this had nothing to do with running the E.P.A.,‚ Mr. Chmielewski, one of the four political aides, said in an interview.Jahan Wilcox, Mr. Pruitt‚s spokesman, disputed the suggestion that aides played an inappropriate role in securing the internship and that the administrator expected them to help boost his and his family‚s standing.Mr. Chmielewski left the E.P.A. after falling out with Mr. Pruitt, but the three other aides confirmed the internship request, as well as multiple other personal directives from their boss described by Mr. Chmielewski. They said Mr. Pruitt told them that he expected a certain standard of living akin to wealthier Trump cabinet members. The aides felt as if Mr. Pruitt ‚ who is paid about $180,000 a year ‚ saw them as foot soldiers in achieving that lifestyle.‚The problem is he is not Trump ‚ he is not a billionaire,‚ said one of the other aides, who spoke on the condition that they not be named. ‚But he sincerely thinks he is.‚ Mr. Trump, taking questions from reporters on Friday, suggested Mr. Pruitt‚s stewardship of the E.P.A. was paramount. ‚I‚m not happy about certain things, but he‚s done a fantastic job running the E.P.A., which is very overriding,‚ the president said. The aides said E.P.A. staff members helped arrange meetings and phone calls for Mr. Pruitt with influential donors to his past campaigns and political causes in Oklahoma, where he served as a state lawmaker and attorney general before joining the Trump administration. The appointments ‚ including with Philip Anschutz, a Denver-based billionaire ‚ were kept off Mr. Pruitt‚s public schedule, the aides said, because it was clear the sessions were not about E.P.A. business, even though agency staff was involved in setting them up.Aides have also been deployed on missions related to Mr. Pruitt‚s personal entertainment.One aide, Millan Hupp, helped book his travel to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., where Mr. Pruitt had secured seats near the 50-yard line for the face value of $175 each, documents show. The tickets, for Mr. Pruitt and his wife and two children, were purchased five days before the sold-out New Year‚s Day game this year.Mr. Pruitt bought the tickets, the records show, from a special allotment for the University of Oklahoma, which appeared in the game against the University of Georgia. Tickets for equivalent seats were on sale on the secondary market for as much as seven times the price Mr. Pruitt paid, data from two ticket companies show.He obtained the tickets with the help of Renzi Stone, an Oklahoma university regent who runs Saxum, a large marketing firm with energy industry clients that have included the American Petroleum Institute and G.E. Oil and Gas.Mr. Stone, in an email to The New York Times, confirmed that he had intervened on Mr. Pruitt‚s behalf to help ‚navigate the purchase of tickets.‚ ‚He asked. I was happy to assist,‚ Mr. Stone wrote, adding that he had known Mr. Pruitt since 2001 and considered him a friend.He later wrote on Twitter that Mr. Pruitt had inquired about the tickets through an aide.In a letter on Thursday, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked Mr. Stone to provide any communication with Mr. Pruitt, as well as any documentation pertaining to the purchase of the Rose Bowl tickets. He also wrote that at least one of Mr. Stone‚s clients had regulatory matters pending before the E.P.A.‚Plains All American Pipeline,‚ Mr. Cummings said in his letter, ‚currently has a petition before the E.P.A. to discharge hydrostatic test water from a pipeline in Corpus Christi, Texas.‚ Mr. Stone said on Twitter that ‚we don‚t do any work for clients at E.P.A.‚ and would be responding to Mr. Cummings. A spokesman for Plains All American Pipeline said its association with Saxum ended last November.Mr. Wilcox, the E.P.A. spokesman, said in an email that Mr. Cummings ‚is misconstruing the facts.‚ Mr. Stone ‚simply connected Pruitt to the athletic department,‚ he said. ‚Pruitt purchased the tickets at face value from the OU athletic department. To report otherwise, is false.‚The political aides said that Mr. Pruitt‚s desire to use his job for benefits unrelated to his E.P.A. work helped explain other actions that have been the subject of public scrutiny, including his first-class airline travel, an aide‚s effort to help Mr. Pruitt‚s wife get work with a conservative political group, and another aide‚s intervening with the chief executive of the Chick-fil-A fast-food chain to help his wife set up a franchise, as The Washington Post first reported.Mr. Pruitt‚s repeated requests of his staff have led some important backers, including Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, to suggest that Mr. Pruitt may have crossed the line and should perhaps step down.ImageMr. Pruitt‚s staff helped arrange a meeting with Philip Anschutz, a billionaire Republican fund-raiser.CreditKevork S. Djansezian/Getty Images‚I‚m afraid my good friend Scott Pruitt has done some things that really surprised me,‚ Mr. Inhofe told Laura Ingraham, a conservative television and radio host, this week. ‚If that doesn‚t stop I‚m going to be forced to be in a position where I say, ‚Scott, you‚re not doing your job.‚‚ Questions about Mr. Pruitt‚s behavior as administrator have led to at least a dozen investigations across the federal government. The newest inquiry, by the Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency, is examining Mr. Pruitt‚s personnel practices and allegations that he may have used his E.P.A. office for political purposes, people with knowledge of the investigation said. At least two former E.P.A. officials said investigators had contacted them.As Oklahoma‚s attorney general, Mr. Pruitt earned an annual salary of about $133,000, and he had assets between $320,000 and $800,000, mostly in investment accounts, according to his disclosure documents. That included between $15,000 and $50,000 in a cash account. He reported a public employee‚s retirement plan worth $100,000 to $250,000. His wife reported no income.He also said he owed between $500,000 and $1 million on his $1.18 million home in Tulsa.The requests to his staff for assistance began on his arrival in Washington, the four political aides said.Mr. Pruitt and his daughter lived at first in a Capitol Hill condominium that Mr. Pruitt rented for $50 a night, even as the husband of the unit‚s co-owner lobbied Mr. Pruitt on behalf of clients. Mr. Pruitt later pressed a political aide to help him find a new apartment, which he then complained was too noisy.Finding work for the administrator‚s wife, Marlyn, also became a top focus for agency workers, the current and former aides said.Despite efforts by a scheduler for Mr. Pruitt, a deal for a Chick-fil-A franchise did not materialize for Mrs. Pruitt. But a spokesman for Judicial Crisis Network, a dark-money group that helps get conservative judges named to federal courts, hired Mrs. Pruitt last fall after her husband‚s aides and a longtime supporter intervened, agency staff members who worked on the effort said. Mr. Pruitt‚s interest in meeting with former political donors, the current and former aides said, was based on expectations that he might want to run for the United States Senate or some other office.During a trip to Colorado last August, Mr. Pruitt reserved time for a meeting with Mr. Anschutz in what was listed only as a ‚private meeting.‚ Ryan Jackson, Mr. Pruitt‚s chief of staff, helped set up the meeting, according to agency officials.Mr. Chmielewski, the former deputy chief of staff, said that when he arrived at the office of Mr. Anschutz, a major Republican fund-raiser and owner of the Oklahoman newspaper, he questioned why the meeting would be among the administrator‚s visits that day. Mr. Chmielewski said an agency colleague told him it was about fund-raising.Mr. Wilcox said Mr. Pruitt was allowed to set up personal meetings during his trips. A spokesman for Mr. Anschutz declined to comment. Mr. Pruitt also had his staff include various sporting events in his schedule, which involved bringing his considerable E.P.A. security detail with him, the current and former aides said.Among the sporting events aides helped arrange for Mr. Pruitt to attend were two Washington Nationals baseball games, including one on July 5, when they negotiated access for Mr. Pruitt to the team‚s batting practice before a scheduled matchup with the New York Mets, according to emails obtained by the Sierra Club. ‚Thanks for taking my call this morning! If we could arrange for Administrator Pruitt to come to batting practice before July 5ths game, that would be wonderful!‚ Madeline Morris, then an E.P.A. aide, wrote in an email to the Nationals‚ vice president for community engagement, Gregory McCarthy.Emails show that Mr. Pruitt‚s wife and two children also planned to attend the July game, and that E.P.A. officials coordinated security arrangements and a motorcade with the Nationals‚ staff. The game was postponed because of inclement weather, and it is unclear whether Mr. Pruitt attended another game instead. Jennifer Giglio, a spokeswoman for the Nationals, declined to comment.Mr. Pruitt did score free tickets ‚ for himself, his wife and his chief of staff ‚ to a Sept. 28 Nationals game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, according to a spokesman for Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, who provided the tickets and said he used the game as a chance to discuss a Superfund cleanup project at a shuttered gold mine in his state.‚The two sat side by side for a few innings and discussed the Gold King Mine issues,‚ Paul Edwards, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement.Last fall, Mr. Pruitt was on hand for at least three home games in Norman, Okla., as the University of Oklahoma‚s football team steamrollered its way to a conference championship, university records show.Days before a game in mid-September against Tulane University, an E.P.A. staff member wrote the campus police requesting four passes for Mr. Pruitt‚s security detail.The university provided documentation showing that Mr. Pruitt paid face value for two tickets for three home games. It also acknowledged that Mr. Pruitt was given special access to a group of 750 reserved tickets at the Rose Bowl. ‚Mr. Pruitt purchased his tickets from a block of tickets that the university holds for discretionary use at all of its teams‚ games,‚ the university said in a statement. Mr. Pruitt on Thursday evening demonstrated how he had kept Mr. Trump, at least until now, focused on his business-friendly agenda at the E.P.A., not his personal behavior and various investigations. On Twitter, he posted a photograph of himself sitting at Mr. Trump‚s desk at the White House, announcing that the E.P.A. had just rolled back another Obama-era regulation, a clean water rule.‚Happy birthday, Mr. President!‚ he added.","For Pruitt Aides, the Boss‚Äôs Personal Life Was Part of the Job","June 6, 2018 /  9:39 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-pruitt-trump/trump-praises-epa-chief-pruitt-under-fire-for-ethics-spending-idUSKCN1J22XA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised the job being done by Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, who is under fire over ethics and spending issues.

REUTERS/Al Drago/File Photo “EPA is doing really, really well,” Trump said at an event at Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters attended by Pruitt. “Somebody has to say that about you a little bit, you know that, Scott.” Trump has repeatedly expressed his support for Pruitt, who has vigorously pursued Trump’s campaign promises to reduce environmental regulations and increase fossil fuel production. But there have been mounting ethics concerns about Pruitt. The EPA chief has been criticized for paying below-market rent on a lobbyist-owned condominium, for his routine use of first-class travel, excessive spending on security and costly office renovations. More than 100 lawmakers, including several Republicans, have called for Pruitt to step down. This week, congressional Democrats released the transcript of an interview in which Millan Hupp, a close aide to Pruitt, said the administrator had her carry out personal errands, including researching the purchase of an old mattress from the Trump International Hotel. Hupp and another close aide, Sarah Greenwalt, resigned on Wednesday, the EPA said. Hupp’s resignation was first reported by The Atlantic magazine.  Pruitt in a statement called Hupp a “valued member of the EPA team from day one.” The Washington Post reported this week that Pruitt asked his EPA scheduler to arrange a meeting last year with the chief executive of the restaurant chain Chick-fil-A. Pruitt eventually spoke with the company’s legal department about his wife, Marilyn, opening a franchise, the Post reported. A representative for Chick-fil-A said Pruitt’s wife started but did not complete a franchisee application, according to the newspaper. Asked about the report, Pruitt did not directly comment on whether he sought a franchise for his wife, according to an excerpt of an interview with Nexstar Media Group posted on Twitter on Wednesday. “Chick-fil-A is a franchise of faith and it’s one of the best in the country, and so, that’s something we were very excited about, so, and we need more of them in Tulsa and we need more of them across the country,” said Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general.  The company and the EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. “Scott Pruitt cannot shift the blame for his scandals to his aides or career EPA employees, said Democratic Representative Don Beyer, a member of the House Natural Resources Committee. “The corruption begins with Scott Pruitt, and it must end with his resignation or firing.” Reporting by Eric Beech and Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Bill Berkrot and Peter CooneyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Trump praises EPA chief Pruitt under fire for ethics, spending",Y

Mr. Pruitt‚s interest in meeting with former political donors, the current and former aides said, was based on expectations that he might want to run for the United States Senate or some other office.During a trip to Colorado last August, Mr. Pruitt reserved time for a meeting with Mr. Anschutz in what was listed only as a ‚private meeting.‚ Ryan Jackson, Mr. Pruitt‚s chief of staff, helped set up the meeting, according to agency officials.Mr. Chmielewski, the former deputy chief of staff, said that when he arrived at the office of Mr. Anschutz, a major Republican fund-raiser and owner of the Oklahoman newspaper, he questioned why the meeting would be among the administrator‚s visits that day. Mr. Chmielewski said an agency colleague told him it was about fund-raising.Mr. Wilcox said Mr. Pruitt was allowed to set up personal meetings during his trips. A spokesman for Mr. Anschutz declined to comment. Mr. Pruitt also had his staff include various sporting events in his schedule, which involved bringing his considerable E.P.A. security detail with him, the current and former aides said.Among the sporting events aides helped arrange for Mr. Pruitt to attend were two Washington Nationals baseball games, including one on July 5, when they negotiated access for Mr. Pruitt to the team‚s batting practice before a scheduled matchup with the New York Mets, according to emails obtained by the Sierra Club. ‚Thanks for taking my call this morning! If we could arrange for Administrator Pruitt to come to batting practice before July 5ths game, that would be wonderful!‚ Madeline Morris, then an E.P.A. aide, wrote in an email to the Nationals‚ vice president for community engagement, Gregory McCarthy.Emails show that Mr. Pruitt‚s wife and two children also planned to attend the July game, and that E.P.A. officials coordinated security arrangements and a motorcade with the Nationals‚ staff. The game was postponed because of inclement weather, and it is unclear whether Mr. Pruitt attended another game instead. Jennifer Giglio, a spokeswoman for the Nationals, declined to comment.Mr. Pruitt did score free tickets ‚ for himself, his wife and his chief of staff ‚ to a Sept. 28 Nationals game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, according to a spokesman for Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, who provided the tickets and said he used the game as a chance to discuss a Superfund cleanup project at a shuttered gold mine in his state.‚The two sat side by side for a few innings and discussed the Gold King Mine issues,‚ Paul Edwards, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement.Last fall, Mr. Pruitt was on hand for at least three home games in Norman, Okla., as the University of Oklahoma‚s football team steamrollered its way to a conference championship, university records show.Days before a game in mid-September against Tulane University, an E.P.A. staff member wrote the campus police requesting four passes for Mr. Pruitt‚s security detail.The university provided documentation showing that Mr. Pruitt paid face value for two tickets for three home games. It also acknowledged that Mr. Pruitt was given special access to a group of 750 reserved tickets at the Rose Bowl. ‚Mr. Pruitt purchased his tickets from a block of tickets that the university holds for discretionary use at all of its teams‚ games,‚ the university said in a statement. Mr. Pruitt on Thursday evening demonstrated how he had kept Mr. Trump, at least until now, focused on his business-friendly agenda at the E.P.A., not his personal behavior and various investigations. On Twitter, he posted a photograph of himself sitting at Mr. Trump‚s desk at the White House, announcing that the E.P.A. had just rolled back another Obama-era regulation, a clean water rule.‚Happy birthday, Mr. President!‚ he added.","For Pruitt Aides, the Boss‚Äôs Personal Life Was Part of the Job","June 14, 2018 /  12:33 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-pruitt/senate-republicans-call-for-hearing-on-pruitt-scandals-idUSKBN1JA01L,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators on Wednesday said embattled Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt should testify before the U.S. Congress to address the list of ethics scandals he faces, but stopped short of calling for his resignation. FILE PHOTO:    EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt testifies before a Senate Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing on the proposed budget estimates and justification for FY2019 for the Environmental Protection Agency on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Al Drago/File PhotoPruitt came under fire earlier on Wednesday after a report by the Washington Post alleged that the EPA administrator tasked one of his aides and sought help from Republican political donors to find his wife a job. The report prompted Fox News television and radio host Laura Ingraham to call on Pruitt to resign. She is one of the most prominent Conservative voices to call for his resignation. The EPA chief has been under scrutiny the last few months amid reports involving questionable spending on travel and use of security detail, connections with lobbyists and industry groups and use of his office for favors. Pruitt currently faces a dozen investigations by the Office of the Inspector General, Congress and the White House. An EPA spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. President Donald Trump has so far defended Pruitt and praised him for carrying out his policies despite the barrage of negative media reports. On Ingraham’s radio show on Wednesday, fellow Oklahoman and Pruitt ally Republican Senator James Inhofe stopped short of calling for his resignation but said if the stream of scandals does not stop, he would be forced to ask him to step down. “I think something needs to happen to change that,” he told Ingraham. “One of those alternatives would be for him to leave that job.” A spokeswoman for Inhofe later told Reuters that while the senator is not ready to call for resignation, “he has concerns about the reports coming out and wants to hear directly from Pruitt” in a hearing. Other Senate Republicans have started to call for more action against the administrator in recent days. “I support Sen. @JimInhofe’s call for a hearing on EPA Administrator Pruitt’s scandals; and I continue to urge the President to take a hard look at Mr. Pruitt’s actions – as I do not feel that Mr. Pruitt is serving @RealDonaldTrump’s best interests,” Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, chair of the Senate environment committee that has oversight of the EPA, said that he plans to call Pruitt to testify before his panel about his scandals later this year, his spokesman Mike Danylak said. Barrasso also sent a letter this week to Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the appropriations committee for Interior and Environment, to request that there be sufficient funding for the EPA’s Inspector General’s office to carry out several open investigations into Pruitt’s conduct. “The Office of Inspector General has not only expanded a number of ongoing reviews, but has also initiated additional reviews concerning a wide range of allegations related to the Office of the Administrator,” his letter said.

28792340,3623,['2018-06-17t19:14:20.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/business/media/amazon-twitch-video-games.html,"Late on a recent night, more than 600,000 people watched one of the most popular video game players, Tyler Blevins, engage in Fortnite Battle Royale with a celebrity guest: Drake.Mr. Blevins streams his near-daily video game sessions live on Twitch, a website acquired by Amazon in 2014 for $1.1 billion. He makes more than $500,000 a month on the platform, thanks to his 250,000 paid subscribers, and some of his sessions can last 12 hours. Mr. Blevins, who plays under the name Ninja, is popular not only because of his gaming skill, which is considerable, but because of his draw as a host.Drake was deferential to Mr. Blevins as they teamed up before an audience that peaked at roughly 667,000 viewers, a ratings record (since broken) for a nontournament live stream. As the game progressed, the world-famous rapper played a supporting role, collecting supplies for Ninja, seemingly content to lend a hand to a master at work.Like others who make significant money on Twitch, Mr. Blevins is a born talker, and he bantered with the fans as he and Drake played. Drake joined the conversation, too. He told the commenters that he liked pineapple on his pizza and explained that he was a Ninja fan before Twitch, back when Mr. Blevins, 27, first found fame among gamers on YouTube and Instagram. The popularity of the March 14 Drake-Ninja summit illustrated how dominant Amazon remains in the game-streaming world, despite intense competition from a roster of tech giants: Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter.Streamlabs ‚ a San Francisco tech company whose software allows viewers to tip streamers, giving the company insight into an opaque ecosystem ‚ suggests that Amazon‚s lead may be all but insurmountable. Its data shows that, in the last quarter, the average number of people watching Twitch‚s streams at any given moment increased to 953,000, up from 788,000. Twitch‚s archrival, YouTube Gaming, averaged 272,000 concurrent viewers, down from 308,000 in the previous quarter, Streamlabs reported.YouTube pushed back against the data, but declined to provide numbers of its own. ‚We have truly gotten bigger every single month in live gaming, and live gaming viewership is up over two times, year over year,‚ said Ryan Wyatt, a YouTube vice president in charge of gaming content. (Ali Moiz, the Streamlabs chief executive, stood by his company‚s report. ‚They should publish their data, if they think this is wrong,‚ he said of YouTube.) Twitch began in 2011 as an offshoot of Justin.tv, a lifecasting site founded by two Yale graduates, Emmett Shear and Justin Kan. They started the platform after they found that viewers were more interested in watching their lifecasters play video games than eat or sleep. Big tech companies came courting, and Amazon beat out Google. In the four years since the sale, video gaming as a spectator sport has gone mainstream, and Twitch has captured the majority of those who want to watch it live.For the dedicated fans, the live, freewheeling sessions on Twitch have the appeal of a major sporting event crossed with a talk show. The interaction between the host and viewers is one key to the site‚s success, making for an involved viewing experience that is markedly different from the prerecorded and edited videos of game sessions that have long been popular on YouTube.On Twitch, the player‚s face, when visible, typically inhabits a small part of the screen, and the world of the video game takes center position. On the right side of the screen, endless comments from the viewers ‚ mostly male, mostly young ‚ appear in a continuous scroll.Until Twitch came along, YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, was the main hub for gamers. But its focus was on recorded, edited gaming sessions, which are markedly different in tone from the long-form streams that have riveted Twitch fans. In an effort to win over the live audience, Google created YouTube Gaming a year after Amazon entered the fray.Craig Riches, who plays under the name PythonGB, has posted his Minecraft videos on YouTube proper since 2010. Despite his affiliation, he said the Amazon-owned site remained well ahead of Google‚s foray into live game-streaming.‚It‚s no secret that YouTube Gaming is still playing catch-up to Twitch‚s platform,‚ said Mr. Riches, 23. The hosts on Twitch, some of whom sign up exclusively with the platform in order to gain access to its moneymaking tools, are rewarded for their ability to make a connection with viewers as much as they are for their gaming prowess. Viewers who pay $4.99 a month for a basic subscription ‚ the money is split evenly between the streamers and Twitch ‚ are looking for immediacy and intimacy. While some hosts at YouTube Gaming offer a similar experience, they have struggled to build audiences as large, and as dedicated, as those on Twitch. ‚You have this really unique live interaction you don‚t get with YouTube videos,‚ said Meg Kaylee, a streamer and host on GameStop TV who built her career playing various games on Twitch after starting on YouTube. ‚It‚s a completely different experience.‚Citing Twitch‚s fervent audiences and the ‚better job‚ it does in communicating with talent, Ms. Kaylee, 20, added that she had never really considered signing up with YouTube Gaming.Other Twitch competitors include Mixer, a comparatively small service from Microsoft that hopes to capitalize on the success of the company‚s Xbox gaming console. Twitter has entered the field by bidding aggressively to broadcast e-sports on Twitter Live, while offering its live-stream platform, Periscope, as a gathering place for gamers. Facebook has also been scrambling to get in on the growing medium, courting individual gamers and adding the ability to tip streamers on Facebook Live as part of its ‚gaming creator pilot program.‚ (Earlier this month, the company also launched a centralized portal for gaming content called Fb.gg.)Facebook Live, Periscope and Mixer all grew quickly in the last quarter, according to Streamlabs, but none have approached the scale of Twitch. The number of those watching game streams on Facebook‚s platform, for instance, increased to 56,000 from 27,500, according to the firm‚s estimates.Even with the rise of live streaming, gamers have continued to do big business posting recorded videos on YouTube‚s main site, which reports 1.8 billion ‚logged in‚ users a month, across all types of content. That makes it much larger than Twitch, which claims around 100 million monthly viewers. Mr. Wyatt, the YouTube executive, noted the full scope of YouTube‚s gaming content, which includes the videos posted on the main site and the live streams on YouTube Gaming, in comparing it with the Amazon-owned platform.‚The size and scale and businesses is not comparable from YouTube to Twitch,‚ Mr. Wyatt said. ‚Everything that I‚ve seen indicates that video-on-demand will be the biggest part of gaming content consumption.‚ He also pointed out that YouTube Gaming offered a different kind of programming: its live sessions last ‚a couple hours at a time‚ ‚ a sharp contrast with the typical Twitch marathons.Still, YouTube created YouTube Gaming in direct response to Twitch. During its first few months, in 2015, the platform‚s hosts complained about the lack of ways to make money and asked for better tools for managing chat streams, which can easily descend into toxicity.‚It took them a really long time to bring out basic features you would have on Twitch,‚ said Cole Riness, a professional YouTuber who specializes in family-friendly gaming videos.YouTube has taken steps to address complaints. Most notably, as of April, its subscription systems ‚ for live and recorded content ‚ have been unified. As for support, Mr. Wyatt said, ‚I would argue that we certainly have equivalent moderation tools to any other service on the market.‚Other challenges have proved more difficult for YouTube Gaming to solve. The site‚s copyright policing has frustrated some hosts, who have found themselves penalized, or even barred, because music was playing in the background of their sessions. Twitch has a reputation for being less punitive ‚ or perhaps just less aware ‚ where copyright issues are concerned.While YouTube has made millionaires out of the creators of popular videos through its advertising program, Twitch‚s hosts make money primarily from subscribers and one-off donations or tips. YouTube Gaming has made it possible for viewers to support hosts this way, but paying audiences haven‚t materialized at the scale they have on Twitch. Now that it seems well on its way to becoming synonymous with long-form live video gaming, Twitch‚s competitors may be running out of time to take their shot.Brandon Freytag, a former Twitch employee who is chief executive of Loaded, a talent agency that represents Mr. Blevins, said the most credible challenge to Twitch may come not from another tech company but from within. The most popular hosts, he noted, could be enticed to leave it for another platform, or create their own. They could also make demands of Twitch itself.The popularity of its stars is a force Twitch has yet to reckon with. For now, Mr. Freytag said, the calculus for hosts like Mr. Blevins is pretty simple: ‚Everyone is on Twitch.‚","With Twitch, Amazon Tightens Grip on Live Streams of Video Games","June 15, 2018 /  9:51 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gaming-e3-content-creators/video-game-influencers-scout-hot-new-titles-at-los-angeles-conference-idUSKBN1JB30V,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Video game influencers scoured the industry’s massive trade show this week to find the hottest new titles, looking for material to fuel their careers playing video games for online audiences.

Designers use predictive algorithms and principles of behavioral economics to keep fans engaged. When new games are reviewed, the most flattering accolade might be ‚I can‚t put it down.‚Now, the World Health Organization is saying players can actually become addicted.On Monday, ‚gaming disorder‚ will appear in a new draft of the organization‚s International Classification of Diseases, the highly regarded compendium of medical conditions.Concerns about the influence of video games are dovetailing with increasing scrutiny over the harmful aspects of technology, as consumers look for ways to scale back consumption of social media and online entertainment.The W.H.O. designation may help legitimize worries about video game fans who neglect other parts of their lives. It could also make gamers more willing to seek treatment, encourage more therapists to provide it and increase the chances that insurance companies would cover it. ‚It‚s going to untie our hands in terms of treatment, in that we‚ll be able to treat patients and get reimbursed,‚ said Dr. Petros Levounis, the chairman of the psychiatry department at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. ‚We won‚t have to go dancing around the issue, calling it depression or anxiety or some other consequence of the issue but not the issue itself.‚Around the world, 2.6 billion people play video games, including two-thirds of American households, according to the Entertainment Software Association. Annual revenue for the industry is expected to grow 31 percent to $180.1 billion globally within three years. Fortnite ‚ the latest blockbuster, in which players battle to be the last one standing in an apocalyptic storm ‚ recently earned a reported $300 million in a month. The industry has pushed back against the W.H.O. classification, which is expected to be formally adopted next year, calling it ‚deeply flawed‚ while pointing to the ‚educational, therapeutic and recreational value of games.‚But gaming has long had an addictive quality. The game EverQuest, introduced nearly 20 years ago, was nicknamed EverCrack for the long binges it inspired. Now, mental health professionals say they increasingly see players who have lost control.‚I have patients who come in suffering from an addiction to Candy Crush Saga, and they‚re substantially similar to people who come in with a cocaine disorder,‚ Dr. Levounis said. ‚Their lives are ruined, their interpersonal relationships suffer, their physical condition suffers.‚Although gaming addiction treatment is starting to draw more attention, there is little insurance coverage or accreditation for specialists to treat it.Wilderness camps and rehabilitation centers have sprung up, but can cost tens of thousands of dollars, with scarce proof of success. Mental health generalists are trying to apply familiar therapies for anxiety or alcoholism to patients with an uncontrollable craving for, say, World of Warcraft.Players seeking help often cannot find it.Kim DeVries, a gift shop owner in Tucson, said she started looking for a gaming addiction specialist two years ago after her son failed out of college and was struggling to hold a job.Ms. DeVries wanted someone who understood her son‚s seeming compulsion to gaze into a glowing screen for 16 hours on some days, subsisting on crackers and pita chips and listening on a headset to strangers discussing strategy for League of Legends. She struck out. ‚They didn‚t exist ‚ there was just no such thing,‚ she said.Ms. DeVries now resorts to forbidding her son, 24, to play games after 11 p.m. ‚At times, I‚ll walk by and hear the tap-tapping on his keyboard, and it‚ll make me shudder,‚ she said. Her son declined to be interviewed.The video game industry is expanding so quickly that medical research has struggled to keep up.An early study ‚ published in 2009 ‚ found that nearly 9 percent of young players were addicted to their games. Many experts believe that the number has increased as games have become more advanced, more social and more mobile, putting them as close as the smartphone in your purse or pocket.‚There‚s a massive tsunami coming that we‚re not prepared for,‚ said Cam Adair, the founder of Game Quitters, an online support community.But some mental health professionals insist that gaming disorder is not a stand-alone medical condition. Rather, they see it as a symptom or a side effect of more familiar conditions, such as depression or anxiety.‚We don‚t know how to treat gaming disorder,‚ said Nancy Petry, a psychology professor and addiction expert with the University of Connecticut. ‚It‚s such a new condition and phenomenon.‚In Asia, a center of video game activity and addiction, rehabilitation centers designed to stamp out uncontrollable playing have existed for years. South Korea bars young players from online gaming portals between midnight and 6 a.m. and subsidizes some gaming addiction treatment clinics. But in the United States, getting care is often an exercise in frustration.Many parents and patients rely on Google and word of mouth. In forums like StopGaming, struggling players complain about being laughed at by psychiatrists. No formal organization exists to set treatment standards and answer questions, experts said. ‚It‚s very wild, wild West,‚ Mr. Adair said. ‚There‚s no consistent quality control.‚As a teenager, depressed and anxious after being bullied, Mr. Adair dropped out of school and began fixating on games like StarCraft in his parents‚ basement in Calgary, Alberta, he said.He told his parents that he had a job, but would sneak back home to play. At 19, he said, he considered taking his life, eventually writing a suicide note.When Mr. Adair tried to find help, he found few resources.He wrote about his struggles online and later delivered a popular TEDx talk. Game Quitters, the online forum he started, now draws 50,000 participants a month from 91 countries. It suggests programming, yoga and other activities to replace gaming.Another resource, the On-Line Gamers Anonymous forum, was founded by Liz Woolley in 2002 after her son, an avid gamer, committed suicide. She maintains a list of medical professionals on the site. But she said she was not always able to confirm how much experience they had with gaming addiction.‚Any type of treatment is better than nothing,‚ Ms. Woolley said. ‚At least we have somewhere to send people other than to their basement.‚Another kind of obsessive disorder may provide a template, and a warning, for activists seeking more support and research into gaming addiction: Compulsive gambling was first recognized by the World Health Organization and the American Psychiatric Association more than three decades ago. Formal recognition from medical organizations helps ‚bring everybody to the table,‚ said Keith S. Whyte, the executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling. Next month, his group will host its 32nd national conference.But inclusion is ‚not a magic bullet,‚ Mr. Whyte said. A ‚complex patchwork‚ of national and state certifications for gambling addiction made it easier for some insurers to deny reimbursement, he said.‚You still have to do a tremendous amount of advocacy,‚ he said.Although reliable treatment for gaming addiction can be hard to find, demand is high.A residential recovery program near Seattle, ReStart, charges adult patients nearly $30,000 for the first seven weeks of care. It has a monthslong waiting list.Six patients, usually men, are initially placed at a rural retreat and weaned off electronics while being taught how to socialize and exercise. ReStart, which is nearly a decade old, started a program for adolescents last year.Hilarie Cash, a co-founder, said she was working to develop a certification program for addiction disorders including internet and gaming dependency. When she speaks at mental health conferences, she said, she often sees counselors ‚taking notes like mad.‚ Addiction therapists are ‚getting called more often‚ about gaming disorder, Dr. Cash said, and many are ‚kind of tacking it onto what they already offer.‚‚They‚re trying to learn as best they can,‚ she said.",Video Game Addiction Tries to Move From Basement to Doctor‚Äôs Office,"June 15, 2018 /  9:51 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gaming-e3-content-creators/video-game-influencers-scout-hot-new-titles-at-los-angeles-conference-idUSKBN1JB30V,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Video game influencers scoured the industry’s massive trade show this week to find the hottest new titles, looking for material to fuel their careers playing video games for online audiences.

He wouldn‚t be cleared to take full swings with his wedges or irons until the Monday after his friends and fellow golfers had departed Augusta National.That didn‚t leave much time for Koepka to prepare to defend his 2017 United States Open title. But his swing coach, Claude Harmon III, knew Koepka would be fine when he saw that he was glued to the television, watching the end of the Masters instead of the beginning of the Major League Baseball season.Koepka has ‚never really been a golf nerd,‚ Harmon said, but not being able to play changed his relationship to the game. ‚He watched the Masters, and I really believe he fell in love with golf again,‚ the coach said. Koepka, 28, who saw himself as a frustrated baseball player slumming in golf for much of his teens and 20s, on Sunday endeared himself to the golf nerds who obsess over the game‚s history by becoming the third professional to win consecutive men‚s national championships since 1949, after Ben Hogan in 1950 and 1951, and Curtis Strange in 1988 and 1989. ‚It‚s really incredible,‚ Koepka said, adding: ‚I don‚t want to say I didn‚t think I could do it, but I knew that it was going to be that much more difficult. And to finally do it, it‚s much more gratifying the second time. I can really appreciate how hard it is to win a major.‚Koepka posted a two-under 68 at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club for a 72-hole score of one-over 281 to finish a stroke ahead of the Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who closed with a 63, which tied the record for the lowest round in any U.S. Open.Another shot back was the world No. 1 Dustin Johnson, who recorded a 70 while playing alongside Koepka, who is his training partner and close friend. This was the first time since 2013 that the winner of the men‚s national championship did not break par.ImageTommy Fleetwood after his record-tying round on Sunday.CreditMike Ehrmann/Getty Images When Koepka won last year at Erin Hills in Wisconsin, he finished at 16 under, tying the U.S. Open record set by Rory McIlroy at Congressional in 2011. But Shinnecock, which hosted the tournament for the fifth time, has been known to flummox the world‚s best golfers, as the late part of Saturday‚s round demonstrated. Amid warm temperatures and stiff winds, it produced soaring scores and scathing reviews of the setup. Koepka, though, seemed unperturbed.‚You‚ve got to keep going, keep plugging away and don‚t get caught up in all the talk and just keep focused on what you‚re doing,‚ he said after his victory, adding, ‚Sometimes you feel like you are about to break mentally, but that‚s what I enjoy.‚Fans enjoy watching Koepka pulverize the ball off the tee. If he had hit fastballs as well as he does golf balls, Koepka probably would have pursued a major-league career. His father was a pitcher in college, and until recently Koepka felt as if golf had chosen him more than the other way around. As his coach noted, it wasn‚t until Koepka became injured and the game was temporarily taken away from him that he realized how deeply he felt about it.‚I missed the preparation, I missed the competitiveness,‚ Koepka said. And that wasn‚t all: ‚You make a lot of friends out here.‚ His camaraderie with his peers separates Koepka from Hogan and Strange, who cut solitary figures on the golf course. Their intensity could be off-putting.But Strange has mellowed with age. As part of his reporting duties for Fox Sports, he walked the final round alongside Koepka and Johnson, and he said he was rooting for Koepka to win. ‚I had a front-row seat and I thought it was fantastic,‚ Strange said, adding, ‚It was fun for me to watch somebody play so well and do something special, because so many of the greats haven‚t done that.‚Reed also had a chance to do something special. He was bidding to become the seventh man to win the first two legs of a calendar Grand Slam. Reed played the front nine in 31, one stroke better than Fleetwood, but played the final nine in two over and finished fourth. ‚I had a chance, I definitely had a chance,‚ Reed said. ‚Just too many missed putts, and at the end of the day, just needed to hit my approaches a little closer.‚Koepka‚s putting was his salvation, especially at the 11th hole, where he drained a 15 footer to salvage a bogey. ‚That was like making a birdie, maybe even making an eagle, it felt like, because it could have been a big momentum shift there,‚ Koepka said.The tournament‚s Father‚s Day finish was a sweet topping on the Sunday drama, with players rhapsodizing about the paternal bonds that cemented their love for the game. Fleetwood signed for his 63, then said he planned to play with his 9-month-old son, Franklin, while he waited to see if any of the 26 players who teed off after him could improve on his cumulative score of two over 282.It was Fleetwood‚s first Father‚s Day with a child and one sensed, from the way his face brightened when he talked about his son, that the day was special even if he did miss the 8-foot putt on the final hole that would have meant a record-breaking 62 ‚ and possibly would have forced a playoff. Koepka‚s father, Bob, watched his son‚s win last year on television, but he made the trip to Shinnecock Hills.‚I told him last year, ‚This was the best Father‚s Day present ever ‚ until next year,‚ Bob Koepka said after the final putt dropped. ‚And I‚m going to tell him the same thing now.‚",Brooks Koepka Repeats as the U.S. Open Champion,"June 18, 2018 /  3:42 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-usopen-koepka/u-s-open-champ-koepka-content-to-keep-low-profile-idUSKBN1JE065,"SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y.

Dennis Schneidler-USA TODAY SportsKoepka’s four-stroke triumph at Erin Hills in Wisconsin last year was almost lost amid talk of how the course had been too easy for a championship that has traditionally been golf’s toughest challenge. But on Sunday at Shinnecock Hills, Koepka showed he has the game to handle any test, prevailing by a stroke on a course with punishing rough and firm greens. “I always feel like I’m overlooked,” Koepka said. “It doesn’t bug me. I just kind of keep doing what I’m doing, keep plugging away, kind of hide behind closed doors sometimes, which is nice, kind of the way I’d like to keep it. “Everyone said Erin Hills was set up for me. It was set up for a lot of guys that bomb the ball. I just happened to play a little bit better that week.”This week is just back to a typical U.S. Open, where one over par wins. It’s just a lot of grinding. But I couldn’t be happier with the way I played.” The 28-year-old said the U.S. Open particularly suited him, both in terms of how his game lends itself to the championship and the physical and mental demands it places on golfers. “U.S. Open just takes so much discipline,” he said. “You have got to be a great putter and just kind of let things roll off your back.  “I enjoy being pushed to the limit. Sometimes you feel like you are about to break mentally, but that’s what I enjoy. I enjoy hard golf courses, playing about the toughest in golf you are ever going to play.” After becoming the first player to successfully defend the U.S. Open since Curtis Strange in 1988-89, Koepka will jump from ninth to fourth in the world rankings. Next June at Pebble Beach, he will have the chance to become just the second player after Willie Anderson (1903-05) to win three straight U.S. Opens. But for now, Koepka is just happy to see his name engraved on the trophy for a second time. “To have my name on it twice is pretty incredible, and to go back-to-back is even more extraordinary,” Koepka said. “This one’s a lot sweeter.” Editing by Peter RutherfordOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",U.S. Open champ Koepka content to keep low profile,Y

He defeated Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla member and onetime mayor of Bogot√°, the capital, who got about 42 percent.Mr. Duque‚s showing capped a remarkable political rise. Buoyed by charm and a conservative upwelling in Colombia, he secured the presidency in an election where many who voted for him did not even know his name a year ago. At 41, he will be one of the youngest presidents in the country‚s history.Far better known is Mr. Duque‚s longtime mentor, √Ålvaro Uribe, a firebrand ex-president who delivered pummeling blows against the country‚s main rebel group and drug traffickers over his eight years in office, from 2002 to 2010. Blocked by term limits from returning to the post, Mr. Uribe now holds a Senate seat from which he wields outsize power. He founded his own party; emerged as the chief antagonist to his successor, the departing president, Juan Manuel Santos; led the charge against a peace deal with the rebels; and chose Mr. Duque, as his preferred candidate.Mr. Duque rebuffed suggestions that Mr. Uribe would govern through him were he to win. But it was clear Sunday that the close relationship between the men helped Mr. Duque get many of the votes that were cast.‚I don‚t know why people say they fear Uribe,‚ Delia de Rojas, 75, a widow who receives a military pension, said after casting her vote for Mr. Duque. ‚He was the one that put order in the country,‚ she said. ‚Now with Duque, we will have that another time.‚ The election was the first to be held since the end of Colombia‚s war with its main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. For generations, the conflict was the center of presidential politics. Yet how the peace deal signed by Mr. Santos was to be put into effect was not often discussed in the campaign, and sometimes appeared to be an afterthought.Instead, Colombia moved toward a new set of questions: How should the country tackle the corruption scandals that have hit it, along with other countries in the region? What should be done about the rising number of Venezuelan refugees who have poured over the country‚s borders? What is to be done about rising coca production?But the war carries a long shadow, and the peace deal affected the fortunes of both men on the presidential ballot.Mr. Duque was aided by his party‚s long opposition to the peace deal; it argued that it was too lenient on drug traffickers. Many who voted the deal down after a referendum in 2016 gave their votes to Mr. Duque.The end of the war with the FARC appeared to help Mr. Petro, too, as the first serious left-wing candidate for president in years. Some analysts said peace may have softened the stance of many Colombians against ex-rebels, allowing a former guerrilla to make headway.The campaign may offer some hints as to how Mr. Duque will govern.He published a book called ‚The Future Is at the Political Center‚ this year and backed off some of his party‚s more right-wing stances. And while he has expressed doubts about the peace deal agreed to in 2016, he has not asked to overturn it. He has, though, suggested some modifications. ‚It strikes me as odd that they box him in as someone with positions that are radical,‚ said Felipe Buitrago, a friend of Mr. Duque, who worked with him at the Inter-American Development Bank before he entered politics. On combating drugs, his stances have appeared closer to his mentor, Mr. Uribe. Mr. Duque has supported a return to aerial spraying of coca crops. The Santos government had banned spraying over health concerns about the chemical used. Mr. Duque also is against considering the legalization of some drugs, a growing trend among Latin American countries.‚He will return to the iron fist of coordination with the U.S.,‚ said Arlene Tickner, a political scientist at Del Rosario University in Bogot√°.Mr. Petro, for his part, ran a campaign in which he denounced the corruption of top politicians and said that for both economic and environmental reasons he would phase out coal and oil exports, saying the country relied too much on hydrocarbons.As mayor of Bogot√°, he had success reducing prices for public transportation and gave subsidized water to the poor, but he was also briefly impeached after a standoff with officials over city garbage collection.Mr. Petro‚s history as a fighter appealed to Jairo Montoya, 20, a hotel student in Bogot√° who was one of many young people who turned out to vote for him on Sunday. He said he saw the former guerrilla as a catalyst for structural changes in the country.‚It‚s time to bring down those who have always been in power,‚ he said, referring to politicians like Mr. Duque and Mr. Uribe. ‚It‚s time to have another kind of government.‚ Such sentiments, however, may have been against the tide in a country which ranks among the region‚s most conservative. Many of the biggest debates now center on the hot-button culture wars that have consumed politics in other countries.‚I am not for abortion, not for same-sex marriage ‚ and Petro is,‚ said Carlota Jaimes, 42, an accountant. ‚I don‚t think to protect women, young people and Christian values, it‚s all right to be in favor of these things.‚Ms. Jaimes cast her vote for Mr. Duque, and headed out of the polling booth.","Colombia Elects Iv√°n Duque, a Young Populist, as President","June 1, 2018 /  12:17 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-colombia-election-polls/right-wing-duque-leads-petro-in-colombia-election-poll-idUSKCN1IX4LZ,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian right-wing presidential candidate Ivan Duque is holding onto his long-time lead over leftist Gustavo Petro, ahead of the country’s run-off election on June 17, an opinion poll published on Friday showed.

Ahead of the run-off, Duque has 55 percent support, Friday’s Centro Nacional de Consultoria poll said. Petro, a former member of the M-19 rebel group and ex-mayor of Bogota, has 35 percent support, according to the survey, which has a margin of error of 3 percent. Petro, who has promised to fight inequality, safeguard the FARC peace deal, ban open-pit mining and shift state-run oil company Ecopetrol to focus on renewable energy, won 25 percent in the May vote.  The run-off will pit the two top finishers from the May election and means Duque and Petro are now seeking support from backers of candidates no longer in the race.  Duque, who was handpicked by former President Alvaro Uribe and whose original coalition included the Conservative party and his own Democratic Center party, will also count on the support of the Liberal party in the second round. The left-wing Democratic Pole party, which had backed third-place finisher Sergio Fajardo in the first round, said on Thursday it will now support Petro. The Green Party, also part of Fajardo’s coalition, has urged its supporters not to vote for Duque. Fajardo has said he himself will hand in a blank ballot, a popular form of protest voting in the Andean country. Meanwhile, current President Juan Manuel Santos’ centrist U Party has told its supporters they are free to vote as they please. The party backed former Vice President German Vargas in the first round in an effort to protect Santos’ hard-won peace deal with the FARC rebels, but Vargas came in a disappointing fourth.

The Greek and Macedonian foreign ministers signed the agreement on the banks of the Prespa Lake District in northern Greece, which the two countries share along with Albania, in a ceremony attended by Mr. Tsipras and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia.The ceremony formalized an agreement that the countries announced on Tuesday.‚We have put an end to the longstanding problems which aggravated our bilateral ties,‚ Mr. Zaev said. ‚Our two countries must leave behind the past and look to the future. Good luck to us.‚For decades, Greece has objected to the former Yugoslav republic‚s use of the name Macedonia, arguing that it implies territorial aspirations against a northern Greek region with the same name. Athens also claimed that using the name was an attempt to appropriate the ancient civilization of Macedonia, a Greek kingdom ruled by Philip II and Alexander the Great.Successive Greek governments have used the country‚s veto to keep Macedonia out of the European Union and NATO until a resolution of the name dispute. Now, assuming the deal is formally ratified, Mr. Tsipras has pledged that Greece will lift its objections to Macedonia joining those alliances. Among the foreign dignitaries attending the tightly guarded ceremony were the European Union‚s top foreign policy official, Federica Mogherini; and Matthew Nimetz, the United Nations special envoy, who has mediated the dispute for a quarter century. Mr. Nimetz, who turned 79 on Sunday, said the deal was a birthday gift. He congratulated Greek and Macedonian officials for their ‚political courage‚ and ‚strategic vision.‚At the end of the ceremony, Mr. Zaev removed his tie and gave it to Mr. Tsipras in a symbolic gesture; Mr. Tsipras is known for going tieless and has promised to wear one only when Greece secures a lightening of its huge debt burden.A decision on Greece‚s debt is expected at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Thursday, ahead of the country‚s scheduled exit from its third international bailout and reliance on foreign loans in August.Despite the signing of the agreement on the name dispute, there was acrimony about the deal on both sides of the border.Late on Saturday, Mr. Tsipras survived a no-confidence motion against his government brought by Greece‚s main opposition party in protest at the Macedonia deal.Even his right-wing junior coalition partner opposed the momentous accord, though that party largely backed the government in Saturday‚s vote. Many regular Greeks are also unhappy about the deal, calling it a national capitulation and betrayal. Thousands of protesters rallied outside Parliament on Saturday, shouting, ‚Traitors‚ and ‚sellouts‚ at the lawmakers inside.Protesters also rallied near the site of Sunday‚s signing, and the police fired tear gas.An opinion poll published over the weekend by the Proto Thema newspaper suggested that seven out of 10 Greeks objected to the compromise reached with Macedonia. Many Greeks reject any alternative name that includes the word Macedonia.The agreement has also prompted protests and political opposition in Skopje, the Macedonian capital.

The foreign ministers of the two countries signed an accord to rename the former Yugoslav republic the “Republic of North Macedonia”, despite angry protests on both sides of the border over a deal seen as a national sellout by some on both sides. In the idyllic setting of Prespes, a lake region that borders Greece, Macedonia and Albania, leaders from the two countries embraced and shook hands in the presence of European and United Nations officials. The agreement still requires the approval of both parliaments and a referendum in Macedonia. That approval is far from assured, as it faces stiff opposition from the Greek public, and Macedonia’s president has vowed to block the deal. “Very few believed we would be able to leave behind 26 years of unfruitful dispute,” said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who survived a no-confidence vote mounted by the opposition in parliament on Saturday. “We have a historic responsibility that this deal is not held in abeyance,” Tsipras said as he and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev received a standing ovation. In the Macedonian capital Skopje, police fired stun grenades and tear gas on Sunday night to disperse a protest rally by several hundred nationalists. A Reuters witness saw protesters pelting police with stones, chanting “Macedonia, Macedonia we will give our lives for Macedonia.” Some of the demonstrators were arrested.  Across the border, up to 70 percent of Greeks object to the name compromise, an opinion poll by the Proto Thema newspaper showed on Saturday. In Psarades, the tiny lakeside community where the deal was signed, the church bell tolled in mourning, draped in a Greek flag. Some 30 km (20 miles) away in the Greek village of Pisoderi, about 3,000 people rallied against the deal and at least six were injured in clashes with police who fired tear gas to disperse an angry crowd on a hillside.  “We don’t accept anything, we don’t recognize anything. For us none of it is valid,” said Costas Venetikidis, a protester. “Macedonia is in our soul, that’s why we’re here.” Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias and his Macedonian counterpart Nikola Dimitrov sign an accord to settle a long dispute over the former Yugoslav republic's name as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev look on in the village of Psarades, in Prespes, Greece, June 17, 2018. REUTERS/Alkis KonstantinidisNot far from the Greek border in the Macedonian city of Bitola, thousands protested draped in national flags, chanting “This is Macedonia.”  “This shameful deal will not pass. We will defend Macedonia’s name and pride,” said Petre Filipovski, 40. ‘WE HAVE MOVED MOUNTAINS’ Following the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991, Greece’s northern neighbor took the name Macedonia. Athens refused to accept it, saying it implied territorial claims over the Greek province of Macedonia and an appropriation of ancient Greek culture and civilization. Zaev, who arrived from across the lake on a speedboat, said the two neighbors had “moved mountains” by reaching the accord. It was “a dignified solution acceptable to both sides”, he said.  Veteran UN mediator Matthew Nimetz, who has overseen talks for a quarter-century, described the agreement as a fair and honorable deal. It was, he said, an example of “how neighbors can solve a problem if they really work at it”. “Today is my birthday,” said Nimetz, 79. “I told my family this year I don’t need any gifts because two prime ministers are going to give me a big gift.” Athens had blocked Macedonia’s hopes of joining the EU and NATO, objections it must now lift under the deal. Others might still object.  “One big concern is Russia. Moscow has noticeably refused to endorse the agreement,” said James Ker-Lindsay, senior visiting fellow at the London School of Economics. “It knows that this will see Macedonia join NATO,” he said.  “Given recent allegations of Moscow’s involvement in other elections and referendums, this will be a real concern for NATO and the EU.”  Slideshow (14 Images)(This version of the June 17 story corrects academic institution of expert in penultimate paragraph) Additional reporting by Michele Kambas, Phoebe Fronista and Kole Casule; editing by Andrew Roche and Ros RussellOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","Greece, Macedonia sign pact to change ex-Yugoslav republic's name",W

The letter came after news reports that Australian politicians were likely to shut the firm out of a potentially lucrative contract to upgrade the nation‚s mobile network over security concerns. It also followed growing concerns among Australian leaders about Chinese influence in the country.Barring the company from bidding on fifth-generation, or 5G, telecom networks would be ‚ill informed‚ and ‚not based on facts,‚ Huawei said in its letter.‚To completely exclude Huawei from 5G in Australia means excluding Huawei from the entire Australian market,‚ it said. ‚We don‚t believe this would be in Australia‚s best interest.‚ Huawei fears that the world is embarking on a new cold war, this time over technology. As Australia may show, Huawei could get caught in the middle.More and more, the United States and China are offering differing visions of the future of technology, each powered by their own national champions. Security, data protection and cyberspying are big drivers of both countries‚ efforts to help homegrown companies and shut out foreign rivals. That hits at Huawei‚s core business: supplying the equipment that powers the wireless age.United States officials have said for years that Huawei products pose unacceptable security risks for Americans, citing the company‚s ties to Beijing and its murky ownership. As a result, large American wireless carriers already shun its products, and smaller ones may soon be barred from using the brand under proposed new rules.Separately, Huawei is also under investigation in Washington over whether it violated American trade sanctions against Iran and other countries. Illegal exports of American-sourced technology were the reason for recent, near-fatal penalties meted out by the Trump administration to ZTE, another Chinese telecom equipment maker.Huawei officials have said repeatedly that the company is owned by its employees, not the Communist Party, and that it is a private firm that does not answer to any government. It has said it complies with the laws wherever it operates. Still, Huawei‚s big worry is that officials in other countries may someday follow Washington‚s lead. Some of America‚s closest political and military allies use the company‚s technology. Customers in Britain, Canada, Germany and New Zealand are among its biggest.Huawei this week pointed to its business in those countries as proof that it can be a reliable and secure partner. It said it had passed security inspections by officials in Britain, Canada and New Zealand. It offered to build a testing center where Australian officials could monitor the security of its gear.‚We have an open invitation for Australian officials and security agencies to meet with our world-leading research and development teams to better understand our technology,‚ it said.Huawei has long been an important supplier to Australian telecommunications companies, and has a profitable Australian business with revenue in excess of 600 million Australian dollars, or about $445 million, last year, employing more than 700 people.Still, the company appears to be increasingly caught in a debate in Australia about Chinese companies.Last month, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull‚s government agreed to fund a multimillion-dollar undersea communications cable linking the Solomon Islands with Australia, effectively blocking Huawei‚s plan to lay the cables for the island nation.Asked about the lengths Australia went through to stop Huawei building the cable, he said: ‚Our concern is ensuring that Australian aid provides the support for economic and social development in the Pacific.‚ More broadly, Australia‚s growing economic closeness to China ‚ it is a major supplier of meat, milk, iron ore and other resources to the world‚s second-largest economy ‚ has raised concerns among some in the country over Chinese influence in politics and media. That in turn has stirred worries over an anti-China backlash that could hurt the growing numbers of businesspeople, students and others who have become part of Australian society.Since the accusations of political meddling, Australia has taken steps to curb foreign interference, introducing a series of bills aimed at strengthening the country‚s espionage laws and criminalizing efforts to interfere in Australian democracy.Australian leaders are trying to walk a fine line so they do not alienate a major customer. Speaking to the Australia China Business Council on Tuesday, Mr. Turnbull said, ‚The Australia-China relationship gets stronger and stronger.‚‚It is built on so many connections,‚ he added. ‚It is built on great economic engagement, it is built on history, but, above all, it is built on family.‚For its 5G build-out, the race is on between telecommunications companies that have been testing the technology for years and are expected to begin bringing the service to consumers next year.Years of exclusion from the United States have not dented Huawei‚s determination to help lead wireless internet into its next era. The company has developed 5G-ready products and patented key technologies. It has hired seasoned experts to represent the company at the global body that is setting the new technology‚s standards. These complex technical guidelines will ensure that different manufacturers‚ gear can be used on different carriers‚ mobile networks.‚Huawei has a very strong position on shaping 5G standards,‚ said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. The company can count on support within the information technology, or I.T., business not only within Europe, but also in Canada, Japan and other technologically advanced countries, he said.‚Outside the U.S.,‚ he said, ‚Huawei has become an accepted member of the international I.T. community.‚",Huawei‚Äôs New Front in the Global Technology Cold War: Australia,"June 19, 2018 /  1:16 A",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-china-diplomacy/chinese-envoy-calls-on-australia-to-shed-cold-war-mentality-idUSKBN1JF045,"CANBERRA/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Chinese ambassador to Australia on Tuesday accused it of harboring a Cold War mentality and said “less bias and bigotry” was needed to repair strained relations between the two nations. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at an Australia China Business Council (ACBC) 2018 Canberra Networking Day event at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, June 19, 2018. AAP/Mick Tsikas/via REUTERS   “We need to see each other’s development and policy intentions from a more positive perspective with less Cold War mentality,” Ambassador Cheng Jingye said in a speech to the Australia China Business Council (ACBC) in the capital Canberra.     Relations have soured since Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull accused China late last year of meddling in domestic affairs, and using loans to gain leverage over poor South Pacific island nations. China has denied any meddling in Australia. The rift has spilled into the trade sphere in recent weeks as Australian wine exporters such as Treasury Wine Estates have faced delays getting some products through Chinese customs.    “It is my belief that in order to ... achieve sustained and sound development in bilateral relations the two countries need to have more interaction and inclusiveness with less bias and bigotry,” Cheng said in his speech. The ambassador did not stay to network with Australian business leaders after his speech to the council as he did at the same event last year. Neither did he attend a Tuesday evening cocktail reception at the Chinese embassy.  Cheng did not attend the reception because he had another commitment, ACBC Chief Executive Helen Sawczak said in a text message to Reuters.  China’s embassy in Canberra did not respond to an email request for comment on his early departure from the gathering. The ambassador’s behavior could be part of a strategy to keep Australia in the “Beijing freezer,” said James Leibold, associate professor in the politics department at La Trobe University in Melbourne. China's Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye looks on after speaking at an Australia China Business Council (ACBC) Canberra Networking Day event at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, June 19, 2018. AAP/Mick Tsikas/via REUTERS  “It’s quite clear that the relationship is in a frosty state and that Beijing is trying to teach us a lesson,” he said, adding that Australia has struggled in recent months to secure high-level meetings with Chinese officials. Editorials in Chinese state media, including the China Daily and the Global Times, accused Australia of arrogance and taking a “distorted view on relations”. NEW LEGISLATION The annual business event took place just as Canberra prepares to introduce foreign interference legislation aimed in large part at reducing Chinese influence in Australia’s media, universities and politics.  Cheng was introduced at the council event by former Australian politician John Brumby, who is a director of the Australian arm of Chinese phone and network equipment company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Any fallout from the foreign interference legislation will likely be exacerbated by an expected ban on Huawei from supplying equipment for the soon-to-be built 5G mobile broadband network on national security grounds. Australian security agencies and Huawei have clashed over worries that the telecommunication company’s desire to supply hardware for Australia’s nascent 5G network poses a data security risk.    Turnbull, who addressed the function after Cheng, said the relationship was a “very, very strong one” and could endure differences from time to time. “It’s important to emphasize the strength of the relationship, the enduring nature of the relationship and above all that it is based on mutual respect,” he said. Two-way trade between the nations has grown since Australia and China signed a trade pact in 2015, increasing to A$170 billion ($128 billion) last year.

REUTERS/David McNew/File PhotoLasseter was the creative force behind movie hits like “Toy Story,” “Frozen,” and “Finding Nemo,” that won Academy Awards and reaped billions of dollars at the box office. Friday’s decision, announced in a Disney statement, followed a six month leave of absence by Lasseter after what he called “missteps,” including unwanted hugs that made employees uncomfortable. “Following his sabbatical, John Lasseter will assume a consulting role at The Walt Disney Company until December 31, 2018, at which time he will be leaving the company,” Disney said. Disney did not announce a replacement but Chief Executive Bob Iger noted in the statement that Lasseter had assembled “a team of great storytellers and innovators with the vision and talent to set the standard in animation for generations to come.” Lasseter, 61, said in the statement that “the last six months have provided an opportunity to reflect on my life, career and personal priorities.” “While I remain dedicated to the art of animation and inspired by the creative talent at Pixar and Disney, I have decided the end of this year is the right time to begin focusing on new creative challenges,” he added. Lasseter joined the company in 2006 when Disney bought Pixar Animation Studios. A pioneer in computer animation, Lasseter was the driving creative force behind Disney’s success in animated films over the past decade. He is chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios.  Disney animation and Pixar films have sold roughly $14 billion worth of tickets worldwide since Lasseter joined Disney, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the Box Office Mojo website. Lasseter took his leave after a report in the Hollywood Reporter last November that said some women at Disney had been made uncomfortable by physical contact from him. He apologized in November in a memo to employees who felt “disrespected or uncomfortable,” but said his intent was “benign.”  Multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against entertainers, businessmen and politicians in the past year have led to many being fired or to resignations. The scandal inspired a widespread #MeToo social media movement by victims of sexual harassment or abuse.  Lasseter was absent earlier this week from the world premiere in Hollywood for Pixar’s next release, “The Incredibles 2” on June 15. Online ticket seller Fandango said this week that the movie is on pace to become its biggest animated pre-seller ever.

The criticism has erupted as the future of 21st Century Fox remains in limbo. Both The Walt Disney Company and Comcast are bidding tens of billions of dollars for control of most of the entertainment assets owned by Rupert Murdoch. Fox News would not be part of either sale, and would remain under Murdoch control.But with the Fox entertainment empire on the brink of being severed from the Murdochs, there appeared to be a newfound willingness to take on Fox News, an enormously profitable arm of 21st Century Fox. The Murdoch-owned company has varied offerings, ranging from its Hollywood-based television and movie studios, the cable channels FX, FS1 and National Geographic, and the TV operator Star India.Whether this was a temporary show of unrest or it signaled a more prolonged period of intra-company squabbling remained to be seen, but any sale of Fox‚s entertainment assets to either Disney or Comcast could take at least a year to be completed.In recent days, several Fox News commentators defended the zero-tolerance immigration policy that has resulted in more than 2,300 children being taken from their parents after crossing the border.On Monday, Laura Ingraham, on her show ‚The Ingraham Angle,‚ described the centers where the children were being held as ‚essentially summer camps.‚ ‚Since more illegal immigrants are rushing the border, more kids are being separated from their parents and temporarily housed in what are essentially summer camps, or, as The San Diego Union-Tribune described them today, as looking like basically boarding schools,‚ she said, pointing to an article about one site in Southern California.Ms. Ingraham then said that ‚liberals have seized on the ‚separated children‚‚ ‚ putting the term in air quotes ‚ ‚and turned the entire image into a political weapon, attempting to emotionally manipulate the public perception of immigration enforcement.‚Later in her show, Ms. Ingraham noted that there were ‚a lot of people very upset‚ about her ‚summer camps‚ comments. She then again referenced The San Diego Union-Tribune article and said, ‚I will stick to there are some of them like boarding schools.‚ She also called for looser rules to allow Americans to adopt children from Central America.Fox News declined to comment on the outcry from entertainers, but the news network did defend Ms. Ingraham from the call for an advertiser boycott by David Hogg, a survivor of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.‚Fox News will never tolerate or give in to attempts to silence diverse viewpoints by agenda-driven intimidation efforts,‚ the network said in a statement. Twenty First Century Fox declined to comment. Tucker Carlson said on his show, ‚Tucker Carlson Tonight,‚ that Democratic politicians and media personalities had given more attention and funding to migrant children than to American children removed from parents serving prison terms. ‚This is one of those moments that tells you everything about our ruling class,‚ he said. ‚They care far more about foreigners than about their own people.‚A day earlier, the conservative commentator Ann Coulter was a guest on the Fox News show ‚The Next Revolution with Steve Hilton,‚ where she referred to migrant children who had been seen in widely circulated footage as ‚these child actors weeping and crying on all the other networks 24/7 right now.‚Turning to face the camera, she asked President Trump to ‚not fall for it.‚As Mr. Hilton began to interject, Ms. Coulter described ‚how these kids are being coached, they‚re given scripts to read by liberals,‚ citing a story published nearly seven years ago in The New Yorker magazine, which she later posted on Twitter.Mr. Hilton said in a statement that he did not endorse Ms. Coulter‚s comments ‚or anything else said by anyone other than myself.‚Suketu Mehta, who wrote the article in 2011 about an immigrant from Africa, said in an email that Ms. Coulter ‚grossly misrepresents my writing‚ and that his article ‚substantiates none of her despicable stances on Trump‚s child hostages.‚‚My article illustrates the complexities of the asylum system,‚ Mr. Mehta wrote, ‚and how even those with a legitimate claim to asylum are forced to create or embellish narratives that will satisfy the whims of a broken system.‚On Tuesday, the filmmaker Judd Apatow implored those working for Fox‚s entertainment companies to condemn Fox News for how it was handling the border debate. ‚If EVERY Fox Star and show runner said this policy was evil and protested to the Murdoch family it would make a huge difference in this national debate,‚ he tweeted.Mr. MacFarlane weighed in soon thereafter, criticizing Mr. Carlson. Adam Scott, the star of the Fox comedy ‚Ghosted,‚ said he was ‚disgusted by @FoxNews and their support for & blatant lying about state-sponsored child abuse.‚Mr. Levitan, the ‚Modern Family‚ creator, said there were many people at the TV studio who shared his concerns with Fox News ‚but aren‚t in the position to speak out.‚He said he had ‚no problem‚ with The Wall Street Journal, another Murdoch-owned property, but added that ‚@FoxNew‚s 23-hour-a-day support of the NRA, conspiracy theories and Trump‚s lies gets harder to swallow every day as I drive onto that lot to make a show about inclusion.‚Mr. Levitan then said he would leave Fox‚s TV studio; he later clarified that he would ‚take some time‚ to decide whether to stay.The brewing enmity between Fox‚s generally left-leaning entertainment talent and Fox News could create even further fallout during what is already an uncertain time at the studio. Ryan Murphy left Fox earlier this year for a $300 million contract with Netflix, in part because of the uncertainty created by the 21st Century Fox sale.The future of the company‚s top executives is also in some doubt.

He had asked Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile to audit their relationships with companies that buy and sell access to consumer location data, known as location aggregators.‚As a result of this review, we are initiating a process to terminate our existing agreements for the location aggregator program,‚ Verizon‚s chief privacy officer, Karen Zacharia, wrote in the letter. Some data sharing, such as for fraud prevention and call routing, will continue, she wrote.An AT&T spokesman, Michael Balmoris, said the company would end work with the data companies ‚as soon as practical in a way that preserves important, potential lifesaving services like emergency roadside assistance.‚ A Sprint spokeswoman said the company was ‚beginning the process of terminating its current contracts‚ with location aggregators. T-Mobile told Mr. Wyden late Tuesday that it would ‚wind down‚ its location aggregator agreements.Last month, The New York Times reported that Securus Technologies, a company that provides phone services to prisons and allows them to monitor inmate calls, had a separate service that let government officials track the location of almost any cellphone in the country within seconds, using the location aggregation system. In one case, a former sheriff in Missouri was charged with tracking people‚s cellphones, including those of other officers, without court orders.Location aggregators generally sell access to cellphone carriers‚ data for advertising, fraud prevention and other business purposes. They say their clients must get consumer consent before getting access to a person‚s location.The cellphone carriers said that they relied on contracts and audits of companies to ensure that consumers had given consent for the data collected, but that those safeguards had failed to catch Securus‚s activity. Securus said it required its customers to upload a legal document, such as a warrant or affidavit, before finding a phone‚s location, but it also said it did not check the validity of those documents. The gathering of location data, and the lapses in the system protecting it, have raised concerns about privacy as more people carry phones that can easily relay such information. It also presented a security problem. Researchers found that LocationSmart, the location aggregator Securus used, had flaws on its website that allowed widespread access to people‚s location information.A LocationSmart spokesman, Paul Sherer, said the company was working with the wireless carriers and did not ‚anticipate adverse impact to current services in the near future.‚ He said LocationSmart had disabled Securus‚s ability to get location data.In an email, a Securus representative, Mark Southland, maintained that the company had followed its contract, which was with a marketing company that worked with LocationSmart.‚We believe that ending the ability of law enforcement to use these critical tools will hurt public safety and put Americans at risk,‚ he said.",Largest Cellphone Carriers to Limit Sales of Location Data,"June 19, 2018 /  3:44 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-privacy/verizon-to-stop-selling-phone-location-data-to-third-parties-idUSKBN1JF28D,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc will stop selling its customers’ phone location data to third parties after an investigation by a U.S. Senator found law enforcement agencies were able to use the data to track people without their consent.

In a letter to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon dated June 15 and released by Wyden’s office on Tuesday, Verizon said it was beginning the process to stop selling customer location data to vendors that aggregate the data. Wyden contacted the major carriers after his probe found that a prison phone company called Securus Technologies with access to such data had allowed law enforcement to use it to track people. A Securus spokesman said the company was authorized to give law enforcement the location of a phone in certain circumstances, under Securus’ contract with the third party data aggregator.  “We believe that ending the ability of law enforcement to use these critical tools will hurt public safety and put Americans at risk,” the spokesman said. AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc said in letters to Wyden that they have blocked the prison phone company from accessing customer data, but stopped short of saying they would stop selling the location data to others.

Hagin, a deputy chief of staff to President Trump and one of the most seasoned government veterans on a team populated mainly by newcomers with little if any prior experience in the White House, plans to step down next month.Mr. Hagin has run White House operations for Mr. Trump for 17 months, overseeing the daily administration of a building often whipsawed by chaos generated by the president. Just this month, Mr. Hagin led a delegation of officials in Singapore who arranged the logistics of Mr. Trump‚s landmark summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.‚Joe Hagin has been a huge asset to my administration,‚ Mr. Trump said in a statement. ‚He planned and executed the longest and one of the most historic foreign trips ever made by a president, and he did it all perfectly. We will miss him in the office and even more on the road. I am thankful for his remarkable service to our great country.‚Mr. Hagin, who previously served for 14 years under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, has more experience on the White House staff than nearly any other person in modern times. But that establishment record made him suspect to some in Mr. Trump‚s circle, who encouraged the current president‚s message of disrupting Washington. A senior White House official, who asked not to be identified discussing internal dynamics, said Mr. Hagin had been repeatedly targeted by others in Mr. Trump‚s orbit, both inside and outside the building, who questioned his loyalty given his ties to the Bush family. Mr. Trump beat Jeb Bush, the son of George Bush and brother of George W. Bush, with scathing attacks on him and his family to win the Republican nomination in 2016, and neither of the former presidents voted for him in the November election.Mr. Trump has grown isolated within the West Wing, according to advisers, and is eager for human contact, even if that means jousting with the reporters whom he calls ‚fake news.‚ He often asks staff members about whether others are leaking, and he recently told one person that ‚the Bushies in the White House are out to get me,‚ according to someone with direct knowledge of the discussion.Mr. Hagin said by email on Tuesday that ‚the Bush thing is overblown‚ and that his departure was unrelated and long planned. He said he had committed to stay just for a year and planned to leave at the start of 2018. ‚But Kelly pushed me to stay and I have great respect for him,‚ Mr. Hagin said, referring to John F. Kelly, the chief of staff. ‚Then the summit came up in the spring and I felt obligated to see that through.‚Mr. Hagin may be on the leading edge of a fresh wave of departures from a White House that has had record turnover. Among others who have been said to be considering leaving this year are Mr. Kelly; Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel; Marc Short, the legislative affairs director; Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary; Raj Shah, the top deputy press secretary; and Dan Scavino Jr., the social media director.If Mr. Scavino departed, it would mark the end of an era for Mr. Trump, who has lost nearly all of the aides with whom he is most comfortable during the past year. Mr. Scavino was one of the campaign‚s original small group of staff members, and he is the keeper of Mr. Trump‚s Twitter feed when the president is not using it himself. The White House is already struggling to fill vacancies. The communications director position has been vacant since March with no apparent move to fill it. Mr. Trump in effect seems to enjoy acting as his own communications director.Mr. Hagin oversaw the White House Personnel Security Office, which handles security clearances and came under scrutiny after Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary, resigned in February after allegations that he abused two former wives. Officials said at the time that Mr. Hagin, along with Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGahn, had learned in November that there were problems with Mr. Porter‚s background investigation.White House officials said Mr. Hagin would retire from the federal government on July 6 and return to the private sector. After leaving the second Bush White House, where he also served as deputy chief of staff, Mr. Hagin and three partners founded Command Consulting Group, a cluster of firms that provide security and intelligence assistance to governments, corporations and wealthy people.A person familiar with Mr. Hagin‚s plans said he did not plan to return to his old firm but was exploring opportunities with several corporations.‚Joe Hagin‚s selfless devotion to this nation and the institution of the presidency is unsurpassed,‚ Mr. Kelly said in a statement.",Bush Veteran Joseph Hagin to Leave Trump White House Post,"June 19, 2018 /  8:50 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-hagin/white-house-deputy-chief-of-staff-resigning-white-house-officials-idUSKBN1JF30Z,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, who led the U.S. advance team for President Donald Trump’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, is resigning, White House officials said on Tuesday.

Bush, and George W. Bush. He has been one of the most experienced advisers at the Trump White House. He negotiated details with North Korean counterparts for the summit last week on Singapore’s Sentosa Island in which Trump and Kim met face-to-face for the first time. He also organized Trump’s first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium and Italy a year ago, and his tour of Asia last November. “Joe Hagin brought a level of expertise and institutional knowledge that is unrivaled,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. “He will be greatly missed by all of us.” Turnover has accelerated in the Trump White House, with the president less reliant on advisers.

It was the latest effort by the Trump administration to pull away from international organizations and agreements that it finds objectionable.It was the first time a member has voluntarily left the United Nations Human Rights Council. The United States now joins Iran, North Korea and Eritrea as the only countries that refuse to participate in the council‚s meetings and deliberations.‚Earlier this year, as it has in previous years, the Human Rights Council passed five resolutions against Israel ‚ more than the number passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined,‚ Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said in a speech on Tuesday. ‚This disproportionate focus and unending hostility toward Israel is clear proof that the council is motivated by political bias, not by human rights.‚‚If the Human Rights Council is going to attack countries that uphold human rights and shield countries that abuse human rights, then America should not provide it with any credibility,‚ Ms. Haley said. Human rights advocates denounced the decision.‚All this administration seems to care about when it comes to the council is defending Israel,‚ said John Sifton, an advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit organization. ‚If the Trump administration‚s complaint is that the council is biased and flawed, they‚ve just made it more so.‚In a series of posts on Twitter, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel welcomed the decision. ‚The U.S. decision to leave this prejudiced body is an unequivocal statement that enough is enough,‚ he wrote on Tuesday.But Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said through a spokeswoman that he would have preferred that the United States remained in the council. He noted that the United Nations‚ human rights ‚architecture‚ plays an important role in the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide.Conservatives have been complaining about the council since its inception in 2006, and the administration of President George W. Bush refused to join the body, citing concerns of bias. Ms. Haley has been a fierce critic of the council since joining the Trump administration and is known to have pushed for a withdrawal.Elliott Abrams, a former Republican diplomat and now a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the Human Rights Council‚s bias against Israel was too much to ignore. ‚There is always an argument for staying, which is that the United States will be in a better position to help defend Israel,‚ Mr. Abrams said. ‚But this council is hopelessly compromised, so leaving is the right choice.‚The withdrawal comes as the Trump administration faces condemnation by rights groups and governments worldwide for its decision to separate children from their families at the border. On Monday, Zeid Ra‚ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for human rights, called for an immediate end to the practice, describing such a tactic as inflicting ‚abuse on children‚ and ‚unconscionable.‚Mr. Trump has turned decades of American foreign policy on its head by attacking or undermining much of the rules-based order that the United States established after World War II. Previous administrations viewed the interlocking network of alliances, trade rules and international organizations as beneficial to the United States.But Mr. Trump has ripped up the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal ‚ both of which were negotiated under the strong influence of world powers. He has also imposed tariffs on the United States‚ closest allies and left the Group of 7 summit meeting this month in chaos and recriminations after he denounced Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada as ‚very dishonest & weak.‚The Trump administration has made clear that it will not countenance the level of criticism and what it describes as slanted resolutions by the Human Rights Council that have historically been directed at the United States and Israel.

It was the latest effort by the Trump administration to pull away from international organizations and agreements that it finds objectionable.It was the first time a member has voluntarily left the United Nations Human Rights Council. The United States now joins Iran, North Korea and Eritrea as the only countries that refuse to participate in the council‚s meetings and deliberations.‚Earlier this year, as it has in previous years, the Human Rights Council passed five resolutions against Israel ‚ more than the number passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined,‚ Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said in a speech on Tuesday. ‚This disproportionate focus and unending hostility toward Israel is clear proof that the council is motivated by political bias, not by human rights.‚‚If the Human Rights Council is going to attack countries that uphold human rights and shield countries that abuse human rights, then America should not provide it with any credibility,‚ Ms. Haley said. Human rights advocates denounced the decision.‚All this administration seems to care about when it comes to the council is defending Israel,‚ said John Sifton, an advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit organization. ‚If the Trump administration‚s complaint is that the council is biased and flawed, they‚ve just made it more so.‚In a series of posts on Twitter, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel welcomed the decision. ‚The U.S. decision to leave this prejudiced body is an unequivocal statement that enough is enough,‚ he wrote on Tuesday.But Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said through a spokeswoman that he would have preferred that the United States remained in the council. He noted that the United Nations‚ human rights ‚architecture‚ plays an important role in the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide.Conservatives have been complaining about the council since its inception in 2006, and the administration of President George W. Bush refused to join the body, citing concerns of bias. Ms. Haley has been a fierce critic of the council since joining the Trump administration and is known to have pushed for a withdrawal.Elliott Abrams, a former Republican diplomat and now a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the Human Rights Council‚s bias against Israel was too much to ignore. ‚There is always an argument for staying, which is that the United States will be in a better position to help defend Israel,‚ Mr. Abrams said. ‚But this council is hopelessly compromised, so leaving is the right choice.‚The withdrawal comes as the Trump administration faces condemnation by rights groups and governments worldwide for its decision to separate children from their families at the border. On Monday, Zeid Ra‚ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for human rights, called for an immediate end to the practice, describing such a tactic as inflicting ‚abuse on children‚ and ‚unconscionable.‚Mr. Trump has turned decades of American foreign policy on its head by attacking or undermining much of the rules-based order that the United States established after World War II. Previous administrations viewed the interlocking network of alliances, trade rules and international organizations as beneficial to the United States.But Mr. Trump has ripped up the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal ‚ both of which were negotiated under the strong influence of world powers. He has also imposed tariffs on the United States‚ closest allies and left the Group of 7 summit meeting this month in chaos and recriminations after he denounced Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada as ‚very dishonest & weak.‚The Trump administration has made clear that it will not countenance the level of criticism and what it describes as slanted resolutions by the Human Rights Council that have historically been directed at the United States and Israel. On her first day as ambassador, Ms. Haley warned that ‚for those who don‚t have our back, we‚re taking names.‚Rob Berschinski, a senior vice president at Human Rights First, another nonprofit organization, conceded that no one believed the human rights council was perfect.

The Ministry of Public Security is investigating what led to protesters hurling bricks and Molotov cocktails at police and damaging some government buildings in Binh Thuan province, where anti-Chinese sentiment boiled over.  The protests, by thousands of people in several cities, were fueled by concerns that a draft law to develop economic zones offering land leases of up to 99 years would be dominated by investors from China, a neighbor with which Vietnam has a rocky history. Police arrested 100 people on Monday night after detaining 102 people a day earlier, although it was unclear how many had since been released. In its evening news bulletin on Tuesday, broadcaster VTV said 80 people were being held. Vietnamese officials have blamed “reactionary groups” for orchestrating the violence. The police-run Ministry of Public Security said “extremists” had injured dozens of policemen, damaged government offices and torched police vehicles. Those who had incited people to vandalize and cause disorder would be dealt with strictly, the government said in a statement. State media reported on Tuesday that tensions in Binh Thuan province had subsided.  “We should not let bad people take advantage of us,” Ho Trung Phuoc, head of the provincial propaganda department, was quoted as saying. “And if we truly love our country, we should love it by protecting social order in our hometown, protecting our peaceful life, our friendly environment and somehow maintain a beautiful image of Vietnam,” he added. Though the authorities often tolerate protests, rallies against China’s perceived aggression and infringements upon Vietnamese sovereignty are a challenge for the government, which is keen to avoid angering a neighbor with growing military, political and economic clout.     In the capital Hanoi on Sunday, police detained more than a dozen protesters during a march where some held anti-Chinese banners, including one that said: “No leasing land to China even for one day”. The economic zone plan did not single out China, but the prospect of Chinese firms boosting their presence has created unease in Vietnam, which in recent years has received tens of billions of dollars of investment from South Korean, Japanese, Taiwanese and Singaporean firms, among others. The National Assembly was due to pass the legislation for the economic zones later this week but decided to delay the vote until its next meeting in October.

Charles de Gaulle, who called on French citizens to join the resistance to the Nazis.As local junior high school students pushed forward to a rope line to shake hands with the president, one ninth-grade boy called out with a touch of bravado, ‚How‚s it going, Manu?,‚ using a nickname for Mr. Macron. Mr. Macron paused and responded sternly: ‚No, no, no.‚The boy immediately retreated. ‚Sorry, Mr. President,‚ he said.But Mr. Macron, rather than accepting the apology, seemed to want to hammer home his point. ‚Look, you can act like a clown, but today is about the Marseillaise and the Partisans‚ song,‚ he said, referring to France‚s national anthem and to another song adopted by the French resistance to the Nazis.‚So you call me Mr. President of the Republic or sir,‚ Mr. Macron said, and the boy responded: ‚Yes, sir.‚Television channels and Twitter users took notice, although the encounter was hardly remarkable. Well before his election, Mr. Macron displayed a penchant for sounding dismissive and unsympathetic when talking to unemployed people, labor union members and retirees. French news organizations ‚ regional newspapers as well as national ones and newsmagazines ‚ have taken to publishing lists of his confrontations.When he changed the labor code to reduce the power of unions and make it easier to hire and fire people, he derided those who opposed his changes as ‚lazybones, cynics and extremists.‚ He told strikers upset over a factory closing in a rural area with few jobs that they should stop ‚messing around‚ and move to where the jobs are. And he has said that the government ‚spends a truckload of cash on social programs, but the people are still poor.‚ Beyond his seeming impatience with working-class French citizens and their views of his reforms, he has shown a tendency to portray himself as a ‚Jupiterian‚ president, or the president as monarch. It is an image of the French presidency as an august office, above the fray, that was favored by General de Gaulle and almost every other president until Mr. Macron‚s immediate predecessor, Fran√ßois Hollande.Mr. Macron also aspires to be a postmodern president, the self-appointed harbinger of France‚s future, yet his tone and language alternates between elevated intellectual conceits and provocative street talk, sometimes sounding scornful, even patronizing.From Mr. Macron‚s point of view, he is just making it clear where he stands; it is up to those listening to decide whether they want to join him.‚Macron is part of a generation that knows how to juggle between different modes of communicating, but always with the intention of conveying his message,‚ said J√©r√¥me Fourquet, a longtime observer of the French presidency and the director of opinion and business strategies for IFOP, a major polling organization.In Mr. Fourquet‚s view, Mr. Macron can sound like an American politician when he tells the French that they have to be willing to go where the jobs are and be resourceful and entrepreneurial. But such a message can come across as oddly dissonant because, unlike American politicians, he rarely expresses empathy and has no qualms about sounding like a teacher scolding students.He is also still very French in his desire to have everyone treat him with deference. ‚There‚s this Anglo-Saxon culture that he mixes with the French culture of the meritocracy,‚ Mr. Fourquet said.‚The meritocracy is, ‚I have studied, thus, I deserve to be where I am,‚ and so broadly speaking, that means the world is divided between those who know, who explain to those who do not know,‚ Mr. Fourquet added. Mr. Macron, who has a tense relationship with the press, appears to like using encounters with the public to showcase his agenda without the intercession of journalists. His official YouTube channel even features videos of such events. One, involving older citizens complaining about a tax increase, says ‚I will explain everything to you‚ in the description.So far his approval ratings, which in many polls hover around 40 percent, are still above those of his two most recent predecessors. What is different is that the divide between his supporters, who are drawn from the business world, and his opponents, who are more likely to be laborers or office workers, appear to follow class lines, which was not so much the case with his predecessors.The result for Mr. Macron is that he is seen by many as ‚the president of the rich,‚ a phrase his most vocal opponent, the far-left politician Jean-Luc M√©lenchon, often invokes.It is also striking that even when he has clearly beaten a perceived opponent, Mr. Macron cannot stop himself from making sure he has entirely humbled the person.That was the case on Monday, when the ninth grader nodded and apologized twice but learned that Mr. Macron still was not finished putting him in his place.‚You need to do things the right way. Even if you want to lead a revolution one day, you‚ve first got to earn a diploma and learn how to feed yourself, O.K.?‚ Mr. Macron said as he delivered a friendly, if patronizing, pat on the boy‚s arm. ‚And then you can give lessons to others.‚",That‚Äôs ‚ÄòMr. President‚Äô to You: Macron Scolds French Student,"June 18, 2018 /  4:17 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-macron-boy/macron-scolds-teen-for-asking-hows-it-going-manu-idUSKBN1JE247,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron upbraided a French teenager on Monday after the boy addressed the president informally as “Manu” and sang the socialist anthem in front of him. Macron was attending a ceremony in northern France to commemorate General Charles De Gaulle’s call for popular resistance during World War Two.  The young man, who looked to be in his mid-teens, was standing behind a barrier as Macron passed along the crowd.  He was captured on LCI television singing the words of the international socialist anthem before asking the president, “Ca va Manu?” (How’s it going, Manu?). “No, no, you are here at an official ceremony,” Macron, 40, told him sharply. “You can’t just behave like that.  “You can act like a clown, but today it’s the ‘Marseillaise’ and the ‘Partisans Song’ we’re singing. You address me as Mr President of the Republic or plain mister.” The boy, shaggy hair falling in front of his eyes, apologized.  But Macron, who is known for his quick tongue and often mixes elevated language with street slang, went on: “You need to do things the right way. Even if you want to lead a revolution one day, you’ve first got to earn a diploma and learn how to put food on the table.” It’s not the first time Macron has been captured on camera giving lessons to those who challenge or disrespect him. During the presidential campaign last year, a striking worker accused him of being a man in a suit. “The best way to pay for a suit is to get a job,” snapped back Macron.

But Italy‚s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, went too far even for his allies this week when he announced that he would conduct a census of Roma people in Italy, a prelude to expelling those without valid residence permits.‚And Italian Roma? Unfortunately, we have to keep them,‚ Mr. Salvini said on Monday during an interview on a regional television station.On Tuesday, he dug in his heels. ‚ ‚Census‚ of Roma and control of public funds. If the left proposes it, it‚s fine, if I propose it, it‚s RACISM,‚ he wrote on his Facebook page. ‚I‚m not backing down, and am going forward. Italians first and their security.‚Reaction was immediate. Luigi Di Maio ‚ leader of the Five Star Movement, coalition partner of Mr. Salvini‚s far-right League party ‚ said that a census on an ethnic basis was not constitutional, so ‚we can‚t do it.‚ Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in Berlin to meet with his German counterpart, Angela Merkel, was infuriated by Mr. Salvini‚s remarks and said that the interior minister ‚had gone too far,‚ according to Italian news reports. The prime minister did not comment publicly.The proposal for the census evoked distant but still-bitter memories of the racial laws against Jews and the Roma, instituted by Mussolini‚s government 80 years ago.Mr. Salvini, leader of the League party, is considered the most powerful political figure in Italy ‚ more so than the prime minister, a little-known independent who was chosen by the governing coalition to be the ostensible head of the barely three-week-old government.Best known for his anti-immigration views, Mr. Salvini made headlines worldwide recently by refusing to allow a ship that had rescued hundreds of African migrants from dinghies in the Mediterranean to dock at Italian ports. He declared that Italy would no longer be ‚Europe‚s refugee camp.‚Though the League and Five Star are theoretically partners, Mr. Salvini has commandeered the political conversation, if not the agenda, veering toward right-wing, populist and nativist positions that have not always sat well with his allies. Italian news organizations noted on Tuesday that whenever Mr. Conte was about to step out on the international stage, as he did in Berlin on Monday, Mr. Salvini managed to steal the limelight. The interior minister‚s comments on the Roma drew the first significant grumblings from his coalition partners, and Mr. Di Maio scrambled to have his voice heard.‚Italians have priority,‚ said Mr. Di Maio, who is minister for labor and economic development. ‚It‚s fine to deal with problems related to immigration, but let‚s start working on the problems of millions of Italians who can no longer eat.‚The Roma, also known as Romanies or Gypsies, are a people of South Asian origin who migrated centuries ago to Europe, where they have often suffered severe discrimination. Some have lived in itinerant communities, largely isolated from the societies around them, while many others have settled and integrated.Carlo Stasolla, the president of the Associazione 21 Luglio, which works to end the marginalization of Roma groups in Italy, said in an interview on Tuesday that if Mr. Salvini wanted to conduct a census of the Roma, he need only read the annual reports that his association has been publishing for the last three years.He would learn, Mr. Stasolla said, that ‚six out of seven Roma pay taxes,‚ most own homes or pay rent, and that only about 26,000 live in camps, ‚segregated areas‚ that were ‚created by previous right-leaning governments,‚ or in informal settlements, he said.He said that more than 50 percent of the country‚s Roma population, estimated at between 120,000 and 180,000 people, were Italian citizens. A large percentage of the rest were from Romania or from the former Yugoslavia, and are considered stateless, ‚so they can‚t be expelled,‚ he said.Beyond Mr. Salvini‚s threats, Mr. Stasolla voiced concern that the government‚s stated agenda for the Roma ‚ which includes closing irregular camps and removing children from Roma parents who do not send them to school ‚ was moving toward ‚xenophobic and populist positions that could violate fundamental human rights.‚ Santino Spinelli, a musician who is one of Italy‚s best-known Roma performers, said he feared that Mr. Salvini‚s statements could have bleaker consequences.‚Instigation to racial hatred starts with words, and gives people the impression that they are shielded from any consequences, so that anything could happen,‚ he said in a telephone interview.‚Many Italians don‚t even know that the Roma were also victims of racial hatred during the Second World War, as the Jews were, and this becomes of greater concern with new fascist tendencies rising.‚Now that the interior minister had closed Italy‚s ports to people escaping war and famine, he could increase his popularity by ‚hunting Gypsies,‚ Mr. Spinelli said.Last week, three white men shouting ‚Salvini! Salvini!‚ drove by two men from Mali and fired a compressed air gun at them, lawyers for the migrants said on Tuesday. They said the incident, in Caserta, near Naples, had been reported to the police, and that the victims, one of whom was hit, were very frightened.One of the lawyers, Ida Grasso, said a security camera near the site where the shooting took place might have captured the license plate of the car. ‚At least we hope so,‚ she added.In February, a white gunman wounded six African immigrants in Macerata, in central Italy, in what the previous interior minister called a ‚display of racial hatred.‚ The suspect reportedly draped himself in an Italian flag and raised his arm in a Fascist salute before being arrested. Italy‚s Jewish community has also weighed in on Mr. Salvini‚s latest move, issuing a statement that said that there was no justification for the ‚disturbing proposal‚ to register specific social groups, and ‚submit them to special security policies that are reserved for them alone.‚Mr. Salvini‚s proposal to conduct a census ‚is worrisome and reawakens memories of racist laws and measures that were enacted only 80 years ago, but are sadly increasingly forgotten,‚ the statement said.But Mr. Salvini‚s openly aggressive attitude has clearly struck a chord. Many Italians posted comments on Mr. Salvini‚s social media feeds praising his decision.A survey published on Monday by the Italian pollster SWG showed that in the three months since the election, when it won the largest number of seats, the League has gained in popularity.Mr. Stasolla said he was concerned that Mr. Salvini‚s populist message was taking root among Italians ‚who believe you can respond to complex issues with simple slogans that single out scapegoats.‚‚This is the real drama,‚ he said, ‚that populism has infected broad segments of the Italian population at a speed we could not have anticipated.‚","Italian Minister Moves to Count and Expel Roma, Drawing Outrage","June 18, 2018 /  6:47 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-roma/italian-interior-minister-wants-census-of-roma-communities-idUSKBN1JE2H0,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s new government plans to carry out a census of the Roma community with an eye to kicking out anyone staying in the country illegally, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Monday. “Unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we can’t expel them,” Salvini, who is head of the far-right League, told television station Telelombardia. Salvini set off a storm in Europe last week when he refused to let a charity ship carrying more than 600 mainly African migrants dock in Italy. Spain eventually took in the boat, with Salvini saying Italy would no longer automatically take in boat migrants, who have used Libya as a springboard in recent years to seek a richer, safer life in Europe. Turning his attention to another group that has often been the target of League ire, Salvini said his ministry was looking at “the Roma question” and wanted to see “who, and how many” there were. Tens of thousands of Roma, also known as “gypsies” and “nomads”, live across Italy, many in squalid shantytowns on the outskirts of major cities and on the fringes of society.   Salvini’s comments drew an immediate barrage of criticism, with the center-left Democratic Party (PD) saying his call revived memories of “ethnic cleansing”. In a subsequent statement, Salvini said the government had no intention of setting up a separate archive for the Roma or taking finger prints, but wanted to protect Roma children who were barred from going to local schools by their parents. He added that he wanted to check how European Union funds aimed at helping marginalized communities were being spent. Reporting by Crispian Balmer.

Titled ‚Passwords,‚ the record deals with the pervasively photographed, wildly opinionated and way over-shared experience of our tech-driven lives, while making sure to avoid any glib conclusions.‚I‚m not some grandpa saying, ‚This technology thing is ruining these kids‚ brains,‚‚ Mr. Goldsmith said after taking a seat in the museum‚s Situation Room (i.e. its conference room). ‚I actually like social media, and I recognize what modern technology serves. I‚m just saying, ‚Let‚s have more of a conversation about it.‚‚ The album‚s decidedly contemporary focus bears comment considering Mr. Goldsmith and Dawes have spent much of their decade-long existence being cast as fetishists of the past. Starting with its 2009 debut album, ‚North Hills,‚ this Los Angeles-based group has been both loved for, and hampered by, the clear connection between its sinewy folk-rock melodies and studiously poetic lyrics and the work of the lions of the Laurel Canyon scene, like Crosby, Stills and Nash; Warren Zevon; and, especially, Jackson Browne. For its part, Dawes has italicized the connection by collaborating, both live and in the studio, with Mr. Browne, name-checking CSN in interviews and even performing a Zevon song in a tribute to him on David Letterman‚s show in 2015. ‚If somebody says ‚Taylor sounds like you,‚ they‚re missing the point,‚ Mr. Browne said in a phone interview. ‚He‚s just returning to an approach to music where lyrics are more prominent, which is something that went away from popular music. With Taylor‚s songs, you‚re rewarded for paying attention to the words in a spectacular way.‚[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]Mr. Goldsmith proudly owns his influences. ‚I would never deny the fact that listening to Jackson helped teach me how to write songs,‚ he said. ‚But I like to believe that, over the years, Dawes has come a long way toward something else.‚The band ‚ which also includes Mr. Goldsmith‚s brother Griffin on drums and close vocal harmonies, the bassist Wylie Gelber and the keyboardist Lee Pardini ‚ began making dramatic strides with its 2016 album, ‚We‚re All Gonna Die,‚ and expanded its scope on ‚Passwords.‚ Both works stretch the group‚s classic-rock influences to absorb the adventurousness of Steely Dan and the sleekness of Dire Straits, greatly aided by keyboard work from the recently added Mr. Pardini. ‚To me, it‚s refreshing to sometimes break with all the guitar songs to let the keyboards lead us,‚ Mr. Goldsmith said. He has also undergone significant shifts in his personal life that are reflected in the new music. In 2015, Mr. Goldsmith began dating the actress and singer Mandy Moore, and last fall they became engaged. In both ‚Never Gonna Say Goodbye‚ and ‚Time Flies Either Way,‚ Mr. Goldsmith kisses his wanderings, and more broadly, his youth, goodbye to commit to a love he can‚t see ending. That‚s a stark contrast to his long history of songs that present love as a projection, a mirror or a deflection.‚Before the new songs, I had never used words like ‚never‚ or ‚forever‚ in a lyric,‚ he said. ‚Now, I‚m willing to stand behind those words because I have a commitment to decency that I‚ve never felt before. For five albums, I would create an image of someone that wasn‚t true to who they were. I‚d be in love with an idea. It‚s not an uncommon problem.‚Mr. Goldsmith said his new view of love accounted, in part, for this pivot toward world issues. ‚When you see yourself as the center of things, it deprives you of a certain level of empathy,‚ he said. ‚With this record, I wanted to stop and think about where other people were coming from.‚The new song ‚Living in the Future,‚ a dense Crazy Horse-style rocker, deals with the ramifications of today‚s fast-forward existence, while ‚Stay Down,‚ a diaphanous, R&B-tinged ballad, captures the desire for apathy that experience can stoke. The ruminative ‚Crack the Case‚ tries to broker a deal between various warring parties in a culture of divisiveness. Mr. Goldsmith personalized the last number by anchoring it to an anecdote about a woman who forgives her cheating husband ‚ not for his betrayal, but for the early emotional damage that led him to commit it.‚Forgiveness isn‚t talked about, at least not as much as I want to talk about it,‚ Mr. Goldsmith said. ‚When people do, or say, things we don‚t believe in, forgiveness can feel disgusting. But when you try to think of someone who isn‚t worthy of it, it‚s hard to find an example.‚ Mr. Goldsmith acknowledges that this key song on the album can be boiled down to the clich√©, ‚Can‚t we all just get along?,‚ which is ‚embarrassing,‚ he said. ‚But I also believe it‚s 100 percent true.

In full live performances, Dawes emulates Mr. Springsteen‚s herculean shows by playing for nearly three hours, the better to showcase the band‚s prowess.

Now even the sale of a minor airplane parts maker is being closely examined for serious risks.In delaying the proposed takeover of the parts maker, Northern Aerospace, by a rival owned by a Chinese conglomerate, British government officials appear worried that even a small supplier to Airbus and Boeing could have important national security implications.It is the latest instance of countries around the world showing skepticism about Chinese money. Lawmakers in Washington are battling with President Trump over whether to lift penalties on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company whose phones were barred for sale on American military bases. And in Australia, lawmakers are considering whether to block Huawei, China‚s biggest telecom company, from contracts to upgrade that country‚s wireless networks to the next-generation 5G standard.Governments from the United States to Germany worry that China will effectively buy up the technologies it needs to create state-funded Chinese giants that would rival those from America and Europe. Over the past several years, regulators in Washington have quashed Chinese investments in American companies working on sensitive technology. This year, Mr. Trump blocked a $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, the computer chip giant, amid concerns about American efforts to beat China in the race for 5G technology. And both the White House and lawmakers have proposed further tightening the process for reviewing foreign investments in American companies, with a particular eye toward China.[Read how China is gleaning technical know-how from foreign firms.]European countries have followed suit, with some calling for a stronger review process after a flurry of deals that gave Chinese purchasers access to innovative technology in areas like robotics. Even Canada, where Chinese investment has long been more welcomed, last month blocked a Chinese purchase of a construction company, citing national security.Britain had sometimes seemed like an outlier, seeing Chinese investment as a way to strengthen the two countries‚ economic ties. Chinese money is, for example, helping to build Hinkley Point, a new nuclear power plant on Britain‚s west coast.But developments this week appeared to reflect a rise in skepticism.The British government on Sunday moved to intervene in the sale of Northern Aerospace by asking the country‚s Competition and Markets Authority to investigate.The proposed buyer is Gardner Aerospace, a bigger supplier based in Derby ‚ but sold last year to Shaanxi Ligeance Mineral Resources, a Chinese industrial conglomerate. That deal was meant to help give Gardner greater access to the Chinese market. Gardner had offered to pay 44 million pounds, or $58 million, for Northern Aerospace. But on Monday, the competition authority stayed the deal while it investigates the transaction. It is scheduled to deliver a report on the deal by July 13.A spokeswoman for Britain‚s business department said in a statement, ‚This is a statutory process we have followed a number of times before to ensure national security implications of a proposed sale are fully assessed and accounted for.‚In a statement on Wednesday, Gardner‚s executive chairman, Nick Sanders, said that his company was cooperating with the government‚s inquiry into the deal.

30180959,3776,['2018-06-20t21:59:06.000z'],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/science/summer-solstice-2018-meaning-sunset.html,"On the summer solstice Thursday, the Northern Hemisphere will dip toward the sun and bathe in direct sunlight for longer than any other day of the year. That will cause the sun to rise early, climb high into the sky ‚ sweeping far above city skylines or mountain peaks ‚ and set late into the evening. The solstice occurs because Earth does not spin upright but leans 23.5 degrees on a tilted axis. Such a slouch, or obliquity, has long caused astronomers to wonder whether Earth‚s tilt ‚ which you could argue is in a sweet spot between more extreme obliquities ‚ helped create the conditions necessary for life. It‚s a question that has been brought to the forefront of research as scientists have discovered thousands of exoplanets circling other stars within our galaxy, bringing them closer to finding an elusive Earth 2.0. Is life only possible on an exoplanet with a tilt similar to ours? Or will life arise on worlds that spin straight up and down like spinning tops or on their sides like a rotisserie chicken? And what if a world swings between two axial tilts? The answer is far from simple. [Get a reminder on your calendar for the solstice and other astronomical events.]Although astronomers have yet to detect an exoplanet‚s tilt, they suspect that they will vary wildly ‚ much like the planets within our own solar system. Mercury at 0.03 degrees hardly slouches, while Uranus leans on its side at 82.23 degrees. Those are two extremes that are far from habitable, even if those worlds looked like Earth in all other regards, said Ren√© Heller, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany.  If the planet had no slouch, it wouldn‚t have seasons. The hemispheres would never dip toward or away from their star. Instead, the poles (which always point toward the frigid depths of space) would be so cold that carbon dioxide would be pulled from the sky, an effect, Dr. Heller argues, that would cause the planet to lose its precious greenhouse gas so that liquid water could never form. But if the planet spun on its side, life might also be hard to come by. There, the poles alternatively point directly toward and away from the host star, causing one hemisphere to bathe under the sun both day and night during that long summer, while the other hemisphere experiences a frigid and dark winter ‚ before the seasons flip. Although such a planet might not necessarily lose its liquid surface water, any life would have to adapt to a world that permanently switches between boiling and freezing. Dr. Heller argues that the optimal tilt runs from 10 to 40 degrees. As such, there are several knobs that must be tuned to allow life and, Earth‚s mild obliquity is one.Rory Barnes, an astronomer at the University of Washington, disagrees. ‚There‚s nothing special about 23.5 degrees,‚ he said. ‚You could have any obliquity and you could still have habitable conditions on the surface of the planet.‚  The caveat is that such a planet must have a thick atmosphere that can transfer heat toward those frigid regions. David Ferreira, an oceanographer at the University of Reading in England, invoked a similar argument. In 2014, he and his colleagues found that even an Earth 2.0 with a slouch as low as Uranus‚s could potentially support life ‚ so long as the planet had a global ocean. An ocean will absorb heat during summer, then when winter arrives it will release that heat, allowing the planet to stay relatively temperate. ‚It‚s a bit like when you put a stone in the fire and it gets really hot,‚ Dr. Ferreira says. ‚If you take that stone out of the fire, it‚s going to release that heat slowly.‚ That allows the water world to experience balmy springlike temperatures year-round. The result paints a hopeful picture of a planet that could be habitable in spite of extreme seasons. It also suggests that there is nothing special about Earth. But what if a planet‚s seasons weren‚t constant? Mars‚s slouch, for example, is currently akin to Earth‚s at 25.19 degrees, but it shifts back and forth between 10 degrees and 60 degrees over millions of years. That means that the seasons and climate of the red planet ‚ which is currently experiencing an extreme dust storm ‚ vary wildly. That could create conditions that make life impossible.  Take Earth as an example. Although our planet‚s obliquity is relatively constant, it does change by a mere few degrees. Such slight variations have sent vast sheets of glaciers from the poles to the tropics and entombed Earth within a frozen skin of solid ice. Luckily, Earth has managed to escape these so-called snowball states. But scientists are not sure whether the same will be true for planets like Mars with larger variations in their tilts.  In 2018, a team of astronomers argued that wild variations could push a planet toward an inescapable snowball state, even if it resided within a star‚s habitable zone ‚ that goldilocks band where liquid water can typically exist.As such, a stable tilt just might be a necessary ingredient for life. It‚s an interesting finding given that the Earth‚s tilt never changes drastically thanks to the Moon. And yet astronomers don‚t know how common such moons are within the galaxy, said John Armstrong, an astronomer at Weber State University in Utah. If they turn out to be uncommon across the galaxy, it could mean that such stability ‚ and therefore life ‚ is hard to come by. The finding makes Dr. Armstrong both hopeful and nervous about the prospect of finding life. ‚This planet is really on the verge of destruction all the time,‚ he said. Although Earth is considered stable, it has still suffered global glaciations and meteorite impacts ‚ and yet life has survived. That could mean that life is hardier than you might expect. But it could also mean that further variations would push it over the edge. Either way, Dr. Armstrong‚s research has made him quite thankful that life ‚ even intelligent life ‚ somehow managed to gain a strong foothold on our pale blue dot.  ",Summer Solstice 2018: The Search for Life in the Galaxy,"May 16, 2018 /  8:06 PM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-galaxy/oxygen-presence-in-distant-galaxy-sheds-light-on-early-universe-idUSKCN1IH2SO,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After detecting a whiff of oxygen, astronomers have determined that stars in a faraway galaxy formed 250 million years after the Big Bang — a rather short time in cosmic terms — in a finding that sheds light on conditions in the early universe. A galaxy located 13.28 billion light-years away is giving scientists new insight into the early history of the universe, with the detection of the oldest-known evidence of oxygen. This Hubble Space Telescope image shows the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 and the inset image shows the galaxy MACS1149-JD1, with the detected oxygen distribution in green, observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an astronomical interferometer of radio telescopes in the Atacama desert of northern Chile.

Postman (STScI), the CLASH Team, Hashimoto et al/Handout via REUTERS  Their research, published on Wednesday, provides insight into star formation in perhaps the most distant galaxy ever observed. The scientists viewed the galaxy, called MACS1149-JD1, as it existed roughly 550 million years after the Big Bang, which gave rise to the universe about 13.8 billion years ago.  Light emitted by MACS1149-JD1 traveled 13.28 billon light years before reaching Earth. Looking across such distances lets scientists peer back in time. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). The detection of oxygen in MACS1149-JD1 was particularly instructive. The universe initially was devoid of elements such as oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, which were first created in the fusion furnaces of the earliest stars and then spewed into interstellar space when these stars reached their explosive deaths. The presence of oxygen showed that an even earlier generation of stars had formed and died in MACS1149-JD1 and that star formation in that galaxy began about 250 million years after the Big Bang when the universe was only about 2 percent of its current age, the researchers said. The oxygen in MACS1149-JD1 was the most distant ever detected. “Prior to our study, there were only theoretical predictions of the earliest star formation. We have for the first time observed the very early stage of star formation in the universe,” said astronomer Takuya Hashimoto of Osaka Sangyo University in Japan. The study marked another step forward as scientists hunt for evidence of the first stars and galaxies that emerged from what had been total darkness in the aftermath of the Big Bang, a time sometimes called “cosmic dawn.” “With these observations, we are pushing back the limit of the observable universe and, therefore, we are coming closer to the cosmic dawn,” University College London astronomer Nicolas Laporte said, adding that computer simulations suggest that the first stars appeared around 150 million years after the Big Bang. The researchers confirmed the distance of the galaxy with observations from ground-based telescopes in Chile and reconstructed the earlier history of MACS1149-JD1 using infrared data from orbiting telescopes. The research was published in the journal Nature.

Roof to unlawfully buy the gun that he used to kill nine African-American people in a Charleston church in 2015.Still, the judge, Richard M. Gergel of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, ultimately granted the government‚s motion to dismiss about 15 lawsuits filed against it, which had alleged negligent management of criminal databases and performance of background checks.Indeed, while the judge noted in an opinion dated on Monday that the lawsuits had uncovered ‚glaring weaknesses‚ in the background check system, he ruled that any failures on the part of federal employees were a ‚function of distinct policy choices,‚ and as such the government could claim immunity under a provision that seeks to stop courts from second-guessing what he called ‚even really bad policy choices.‚The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is operated by the F.B.I., had demonstrated in a variety of ways that it was ‚hopelessly stuck in 1995,‚ Judge Gergel wrote. Still, he added later, ‚the victims of this tragedy‚ had no legal remedy. An F.B.I. spokesman at the agency‚s office in Columbia directed questions to the agency‚s headquarters and public affairs office. The F.B.I.‚s national press office in Washington did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on Tuesday night.Andrew J. Savage III, a lawyer who represents multiple survivors and the families of several of those killed in the shooting, said in an email early Wednesday that he and a co-counsel would consult with their clients and ‚explore our options, both legal and political.‚‚We know that this setback is not our final step,‚ he said.Calling the current background check system ‚a sham,‚ he added, ‚No need to review the facts as everyone is in agreement that grievous bureaucratic errors were made arising from apathetic negligence.‚The court order described what F.B.I. officials had acknowledged less than a month after the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church: Mr. Roof, who was 21 at the time, had been allowed to buy the .45-caliber handgun he used in the killings in April 2015 despite having previously admitted to drug possession, which should have disqualified him from making the purchase.Instead, crucial information about Mr. Roof‚s drug arrest made its way into a database called the National Data Exchange ‚ but it was never unearthed by the examiner running a background check on Mr. Roof, because examiners don‚t actually have direct access to the National Data Exchange, Judge Gergel wrote in his order. That policy decision by F.B.I. officials, he said, was ‚the most obvious‚ of several ‚poor‚ choices. The examiner, Judge Gergel wrote, ended up stumbling over inaccurate information because of clerical errors, had to send a series of faxes and ‚made no effort‚ to contact the law enforcement agency that arrested Mr. Roof, despite being told which agency it was.It was common, the judge wrote, ‚to make a single fax inquiry to a law enforcement agency and to attempt no further follow-up of any type.‚So after three business days passed with no denial issued, the firearms dealer, Shooter‚s Choice, was able to sell Mr. Roof the gun, and eventually it did.‚The record reveals that the F.B.I.‚s background check system is disturbingly superficial, excessively micromanaged by rigid standard operating procedures, and obstructed by policies that deny the overworked and overburdened examiners access to the most comprehensive law enforcement federal database,‚ Judge Gergel wrote.‚Reports by the F.B.I.‚s Inspection Division and the then F.B.I. director, James Comey, make much of the fact that the examiners adhered to every policy and procedure of the agency,‚ he continued. ‚Since little is required, it was hardly difficult.""On June 17, 2015 ‚ about two months after Mr. Roof procured the gun ‚ he showed up in Emanuel‚s fellowship hall and was offered a seat for Bible study. About 40 minutes later, with the parishioners‚ eyes closed for a benediction, Mr. Roof pulled the weapon out, and began to fire seven magazines of hollow-point rounds.‚We are all sick this happened,‚ James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, said when explaining the background check failures weeks later. ‚We wish we could turn back time. From this vantage point, everything seems obvious.‚Mr. Roof, a white supremacist, was condemned to death by a federal jury in January 2017.‚Perhaps the F.B.I., learning fully the details of the failure of its system in this tragic series of events, will promptly take corrective steps to prevent a similar failure of the system in the future,‚ Judge Gergel concluded.",U.S. Judge Harshly Criticizes F.B.I.

REUTERS/Grace Beahm/Pool U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel also criticized what he called “abysmally poor” Federal Bureau of Investigation policies for the system that allowed Dylann Roof buy the gun he used to kill nine people, all African-Americans, at a historic black church in Charleston. In his ruling released late Monday, Gergel said that the government had immunity from being sued for its policies, “even really bad policy choices.”  Wrongful death lawsuits filed by survivors and family members of victims of the shooting alleged that at least one of the background check databases maintained by the federal government had information that should have prevented the firearm sale. Gergel criticized the FBI’s policy to deny background check examiners access to the database, known as N-DEx. If the examiner assigned to Roof’s purchase request had been able to access N-DEx, he would have seen Roof’s 2015 drug arrest and would have barred him from buying the gun, Gergel wrote in his decision. The government’s argument in the case that it had to deny background check employees access to N-DEx, as it was restricted to law enforcement agencies, was “simple nonsense,” Gergel wrote. The judge suggested the FBI take corrective steps to prevent a similar failure in the future. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency does not comment on litigation cases. Mullins Mcleod, a lawyer representing several of the plaintiffs in the case, was not immediately for comment. The FBI runs federal background checks for gun dealers in more than 30 states, including South Carolina. The examiner who conducted Roof’s check did not see a police report in which Roof admitted to unlawful drug possession, which would have barred him from buying the weapon, former FBI director James Comey said following the shooting.

Trump began his presidential bid by maligning Mexican immigrants, Representative Will Hurd, a Texas Republican in a Democratic-leaning district, has faced voters of all stripes who were angry about Mr. Trump‚s divisive style.But Mr. Hurd, who represents a heavily Hispanic region that stretches across 800 miles of the Mexican border, could not recall a moment when people were as appalled as they were over the images of anguished children separated from their migrant parents.‚All the calls and emails I‚ve gotten in my office are from constituents saying: ‚Why are we doing this, this is against our values,‚‚ Mr. Hurd said. The president‚s policy had damaged the Republican brand, he said, because ‚nobody understands why you would take children out of their parents‚ hands.‚Yet many rank-and-file Republican voters in border states see it differently, creating another kind of pressure for lawmakers like Mr. Hurd. Whatever sympathy these voters feel for the children is complicated, they say, by their intense frustration over the flow of migrants from Mexico. In interviews across the Southwest and Florida on Wednesday, many Republicans said that they appreciated President Trump‚s emphasis on ‚zero tolerance‚ for illegal border crossings, and wished there were as much furor over those immigrants as there was over the separation of parents and children ‚ an administration policy that Mr. Trump reversed under pressure from Republicans like Mr. Hurd.‚You don‚t ever want to be separating families, but at least the president focused attention on all the people crossing the border illegally,‚ said Helen Delavan, 79, a retired school secretary in Castroville, Tex., and a supporter of both Mr. Trump and Mr. Hurd.Marcella Lagleder, 65, a retired software developer who runs an arts and crafts shop in Castroville, said the political turmoil over migrant families left her wondering ‚why we‚re still being so open to the illegals.‚ ‚I don‚t think we‚re mistreating them,‚ Ms. Lagleder said. ‚It‚d be different if they were put in a doghouse or something like that.‚ From Arizona and New Mexico to Texas and Florida, conservative-leaning voters were divided over how to handle the families and on immigration policy more broadly, a reflection of the Republican fissures that have stymied immigration legislation for over a decade. Interviews with these voters in some of the most hotly contested, heavily Hispanic states and congressional districts illustrate the bind Republicans find themselves in: They need to retain support from voters who have little sympathy for undocumented immigrants and also win over more moderate voters horrified by Mr. Trump‚s remarks about Hispanics.Republican lawmakers and strategists said the president‚s ‚zero tolerance‚ policy had created a political crisis for the party at a time when Republicans badly want to be taking credit for the improving economy. Instead of talking about the second-quarter economic growth that could near 5 percent, Republicans worry they are handing Democrats a potent line of attack for the midterms.Yet while the searing photographs of children locked in cages left many Democrats and independents deeply dismayed, many Republicans were less sympathetic about the plight of migrants who knowingly broke the law.Julio Martinez, 74, who headed Mr. Trump‚s Miami-area campaign, defended the president‚s hard-line approach.‚It hurts my heart to see it, but the culpable ones are the parents who subject their children to crossing the border, or who send them by themselves,‚ Mr. Martinez said. ‚If we start breaking laws ourselves, what is this country going to become? All of those multimillionaires who live in Hollywood, why don‚t they let all those illegals live in their houses?‚But Michelle Garcia, 42, a cafe owner in Los Lunas, N.M., where there is an open House seat in a district that is majority-Hispanic and likely to be highly competitive, said the family separations had been ‚merciless and counterproductive.‚ ‚I‚m a conservative and I don‚t believe that this is the solution,‚ she said.[Here are the myths and realities of global immigration.] But what‚s especially worrisome for Republicans in states like Florida, where there are hard-fought races for governor, Senate and a handful of House seats this year, is that the president is not just alienating voters with his policies. Equally troubling is his use of harsh and demagogic language when describing Latinos, a tone he seemed to amplify in a series of tweets and speeches as pressure on him grew this week.Mr. Trump‚s claim that unauthorized migrants ‚infest our country,‚ for example, has left some Hispanic Republicans angry and concerned that he‚s driving away up-for-grabs voters.‚It‚s unbelievable,‚ said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a veteran Florida Republican who is of Cuban descent. ‚That kind of divisive language hurts us.‚Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican locked in a highly competitive re-election fight, said Mr. Trump‚s warnings about the threat of migrants had ‚been dehumanizing.‚There are few House Republicans who are as frustrated with the Trump administration over immigration as Mr. Curbelo, who represents one of the most Democratic-leaning districts of any Republican in the country and has been working for months on a compromise for ‚Dreamers,‚ those brought to the country illegally as children.In an interview, he complained that the family separation policy was ‚a unilateral decision by Jeff Sessions,‚ adding that the hard-line attorney general has ‚freelanced on a number of issues.‚ What is clear from the interviews with voters, however, is that Mr. Trump‚s warnings about the peril presented by immigrants are being heard ‚ and echoed by some of his supporters.‚The last thing I want is this place to end up like Germany or Europe, where they‚re blowing up stuff and knife attacks and things like that,‚ said Ryan Farnsworth, 44, who works in the construction industry in Phoenix and voted for the president. [As word of the policy spread among migrants in Mexico, some reconsidered their trips. Others did not.]Mr. Farnsworth was sounding the same note Mr. Trump did this week, when he falsely claimed that crime in Germany had spiked and said Chancellor Angela Merkel‚s coalition was at risk because of permissive refugee policies.Standing next to a bank of Spanish-language newspapers outside the Maricopa County Courthouse, Mr. Farnsworth said that he saw the president‚s family separation policy as an unfortunate but practical deterrent that could have helped secure the borders.‚Do I like seeing families pulled apart? Absolutely not,‚ he said, just as a Hispanic woman and her young son scooted by, hand in hand. ‚But it is no different than if I were to go commit a crime, I went to jail, I‚d lose my children, too; they‚d be stripped from me.‚ It is voters like Mr. Farnsworth who have created pressure on Republican politicians like Representative Martha McSally, who is running for Senate in Arizona and trying to accommodate the hard-liners who dominate the Republican Party‚s overwhelmingly white base there without offending the broader, more racially diverse electorate.And the challenge is even more acute on the border, where Lea M√°rquez-Peterson is running for Ms. McSally‚s seat in a district that includes both staunch border hawks and recent immigrants.‚It‚s a very split district,‚ said Ms. M√°rquez-Peterson, a Republican who previously ran the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. ‚We should have passed a comprehensive immigration bill years ago.‚In New Mexico ‚ which has the highest percentage of citizens with Hispanic ancestry in the country ‚ voters more frequently expressed discomfort with the separation policy. ‚It‚s sad,‚ said Andrew Baca, 28, a Belen, N.M., barber and former soldier who is Latino. ‚We‚re all immigrants, bro. America is made of immigrants.‚But the challenge for Democrats in this sprawling and heavily rural New Mexico district currently held by Representative Steve Pearce, a Republican, is that voters who may not like Mr. Trump‚s immigration policies are uneasy with the liberal line on guns and abortion rights. ‚My vote wouldn‚t necessarily change because of the separation only,‚ Mr. Baca said.Back in Mr. Hurd‚s district ‚ which includes the Tornillo holding facility where some of the children have been detained ‚ his Democratic opponent, Gina Ortiz Jones, suggested the incumbent‚s outrage was inspired by his re-election bid.‚It took kids in cages for him to speak up,‚ said Ms. Ortiz Jones, a former Air Force officer, arguing that the Republican‚s voting record suggested fidelity to Mr. Trump.But the good news for Mr. Hurd, a former C.I.A. officer who survived 2016 even as Hillary Clinton carried the district, is that many voters here say they intend to support him, no matter their view on the separation of children from their parents.Robert Belitz, a Democrat selling melons from the back of his truck on the main road cutting through Castroville, expressed disgust at the policy.‚This isn‚t some authoritarian state,‚ he said, before adding he would still back Mr. Hurd, whom he deemed ‚a good man who delivers on what he says.‚For Mr. Hurd to win again along the Rio Grande, he would need such voters to remain in his corner ‚ and for Mr. Trump to not make that task more difficult.‚Whenever we‚re not able to talk about how the economy is doing well, how unemployment is low, and instead we‚re talking about taking babies from their mothers ‚ that‚s not an environment that‚s going to be helpful,‚ Mr. Hurd said.",Republicans Dislike Separating Families. But They Like ‚ÄòZero Tolerance‚Äô More.,"June 20, 2018 /  12:16 ",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-election-republicans/at-risk-republicans-separate-themselves-from-trumps-border-policy-idUSKBN1JG017," MODESTO, Calif./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s policy of separating immigrant parents and their children at the U.S.-Mexico border has vulnerable Republican congressional candidates scrambling to distance themselves from the issue - but not from the president. Immigrant children now housed in a tent encampment under the new ""zero tolerance"" policy by the Trump administration are shown walking in single file at the facility near the Mexican border in Tornillo, Texas, U.S. June 19, 2018.  REUTERS/Mike BlakeAs images of youngsters in cages and an audiotape of wailing children affected by Trump’s “zero-tolerance” policy filled worldwide media, the overwhelming majority of Republicans in competitive districts in November’s elections issued statements and took to social media to try to tell voters that they did not condone removing children from their parents. At the same time, many of those Republicans dared not stray too far from Trump and his agenda, given his popularity with his conservative base. Mark Harris, a conservative pastor who is trying to win a seat in a district outside Charlotte, North Carolina, said in a statement when his campaign was contacted by Reuters that he has “a growing concern with what is happening” and urged Congress to act. “Children must not be separated from their parents unless there is a real threat to the safety of the children or if the parents are involved in serious criminal behavior,” said Harris, who otherwise supports Trump’s policies, including building a border wall between Mexico and the United States. Republican candidates in suburban districts near Denver, Houston, Miami, Philadelphia, and in southern California also came out against the policy, leaving a handful in battleground races who had not done so. “If you are a congressional Republican, this is a nightmare,” said Joe Brettell, a Republican strategist in Houston. “Wait until the ads start running showing that Republican congressman X supported the tearing of families apart and that’s when we’ll find out just how strong Republican resolve is on this issue.” Centrist Republicans are increasing the pressure already with an ad shared exclusively with Reuters, that will be released online by the centrist group New Way on Wednesday. It shows a child peering through a chain-link fence as a woman’s voice criticizes the family separation practice. “It’s immoral. It’s cruel. And it has to stop,” the ad says. NO DOWNSIDE FOR DEMOCRATS Democrats kept a united front, seizing upon the issue to hammer Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. Every Democrat in the U.S. Senate, even those who face difficult bids for re-election in Trump-friendly states, have signed onto a bill that would overturn the family separation policy. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero tolerance” policy in April that all immigrants apprehended while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally should be criminally prosecuted under the country’s criminal entry statute. While migrants are jailed pending trial, their children either remain in border patrol custody or are moved into shelters. U.S. President Donald Trump departs from a closed House Republican Conference meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 19, 2018. REUTERS/Leah MillisDemocrats need to secure 23 more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives to gain control of the chamber. If they succeed, much of Trump’s agenda would be stymied. Opinion polls show the Trump policy to be unpopular with most Americans, although Republicans back it. “Swing voters, soccer moms, middle-class voters are being turned off by what they are seeing down there,” Democratic strategist Jim Manley said.  Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster involved in Senate races, said the controversy was particularly potent in House districts that contain a significant Hispanic population or have large pockets of highly-educated, moderate Republicans. Jeff Denham, a Republican congressman from Turlock, in California’s Central Valley, is among those endangered candidates seeking to chart his own path through the issue, even as he is being pressed from all sides by Trump supporters, moderate Republicans, and his Democratic opponent. Denham’s district is about 40 percent Hispanic. Election analysts say the race is essentially a toss-up between him and his Democratic opponent, Josh Harder, who called the administration’s policy “barbaric.” Although Denham opposes separating families, he has declined to criticize Trump or the zero-tolerance policy. He is backing a compromise meant to keep families together. Denham has spearheaded an effort in the House for a vote on an immigration measure favored by moderates that would provide legal relief to “Dreamers” - young immigrants whose deportation was deferred under the Obama administration. Some conservatives in his district would prefer Denham take a tougher stance. “He ought to stick with what the president wants,” said Jim DeMartini, chairman of the Stanislaus County Republican Party. Kristin Olsen, a county supervisor from suburban Modesto, represents a more centrist political view. Opinion polls have shown educated, suburban women such as Olsen to be particularly critical of Trump’s policy. She called the policy immoral. The threat to Republicans in swing districts was enough to push Representative Steve Stivers, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, to break with Trump. “If the policy is not changed, I will support other means to stop the unnecessary separation of children from their parents,” Stivers, from a suburban district in Ohio, wrote on Facebook.

As the assailants broke through each barricade, the defenders sprinted back through the empty streets, past families watching from doorways, poised to bolt inside at the first sign of danger.But in the end, the resistance was no match for the firepower and men sent by the government of President Daniel Ortega on Tuesday to rescue the police commander who had been assigned to quell Masaya, only to be held hostage for weeks at police headquarters.A day that began to the ringing of church bells, sounded to alert Masaya‚s citizens, ended with at least four dead and more than 30 injured, but the town remained defiant. ‚That they reached the city does not mean that we are surrendering,‚ said Yubrank Suazo, the spokesman in the city for the insurrection known as the April 19 Movement.It has been two months since Nicaraguans rose up in an enormous wave to demand the end of Mr. Ortega‚s leadership, a repudiation of the man who has dominated the country‚s political life for nearly 40 years. The early power of those protests, when it seemed as if the sheer rage on the street would topple a hero of the 1979 revolution, has given way to the realization that Mr. Ortega and his vice president and wife, Rosario Murillo, are holding fast. What is emerging instead is a campaign of terror by government-backed paramilitary forces, often accompanied by anti-riot police, that appears to be calculated to cow citizens into resignation.At the same time, the government is engaged in halting negotiations with an unwieldy alliance of opposing groups, including the students who first began the protest movement, along with business and farmers‚ organizations. On the streets, many people say they want the presidential couple to leave now. But the Roman Catholic Church, which is mediating the dialogue, has proposed holding early elections by March.This week, the State Department said that ‚early elections represent a constructive way forward.‚ And the United States ambassador to the Organization of American States, Carlos Trujillo, arrived in the capital, Managua, on Tuesday to meet with the government and opposition groups.Jaime Wheelock ‚ who once served, with Mr. Ortega, as one of the nine revolutionary commanders of the Sandinista National Liberation Front ‚ said dialogue was the only route out of the current political crisis.‚I am worried about a slow climb in violence that could turn into low-intensity armed conflict,‚ warned Mr. Wheelock, who left politics after the Sandinistas lost the 1990 election. ‚The international community doesn‚t appear to understand the seriousness of the situation, and while they don‚t, the Nicaraguan population is defenseless.‚ The church‚s agenda envisions rolling back the iron control Mr. Ortega has established over the legislature, the judiciary and electoral authorities since he returned to power in 2007, and guaranteeing political parties the freedom to compete fairly in elections. The president has not responded clearly to the proposal, but he has not rejected it.Both sides agreed on the first step: an invitation to international rights organizations to investigate the violence that has killed more than 180 people in two months. The government has yet to present letters of invitation, though, and the opposition alliance temporarily suspended talks on Tuesday. ‚You cannot be in a dialogue on the one hand and killing and murdering on the other,‚ √Ålvaro Leiva S√°nchez, the secretary of the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights, said after the violence in Masaya. ‚It‚s not possible.‚The intimidation takes different forms. Masked men bang down doors in the early morning and haul off suspects, snipers shoot to kill at protest marches, and paramilitaries dismantle the barricades protesters have built with paving stones pried from the streets.In an attack that horrified Nicaraguans, six members of the Vel√°squez Pav√≥n family, including a baby and a toddler, died on Saturday when masked men set fire to the three-story building that housed their mattress store and living quarters.A daughter who jumped from a balcony and survived told local news outlets that paramilitary forces had demanded that the family allow a sniper to take a position on their roof. When the family refused, the gunmen lit the fire and barred the family from escaping. The government has argued that the protesters are vandals and terrorists, a position that Ms. Murillo repeated in one of her regular noon speeches on Tuesday.‚Our Comandante Daniel‚ she said, was committed to stopping ‚hate crimes, kidnappings, the burning of houses‚ and ‚atrocities without limits.‚ Whether the violence against the government‚s opponents will succeed in suppressing their protests or will instead strengthen their resolve is unclear.The mass demonstrations in Managua in the early weeks of unrest stopped after gunmen fired at a march on May 30, Nicaragua‚s Mother‚s Day, killing 15 people. This week, a few dozen protesters gathered at a traffic circle marked with crosses for those killed in the violence, waving flags at passing motorists.‚We‚re here to take back the street,‚ declared Edwin Carcache, 27, one of the leaders of the student movement. He had a warning for Mr. Ortega: ‚If the people put you there, the people can also remove you. Citizens are beginning to claim their true rights.‚Sara Maritza Oporto, 47, saw the crackdown up close when her son, Guillermo Sobalvarro, 23, was arrested while on his way to a market on Friday. Four days later, all she knew was that he was in the Managua jail known as El Chipote, and she waited outside the gates with other mothers, passing food and soap through its bars to a police officer.‚I will be honest,‚ she said. ‚We have participated in the protest marches and we will continue to do so because it is not a crime.‚She said that she planned to send her son to Costa Rica once he was released, but that she would stay. ‚I want a free country, where it‚s not a crime to be young.‚",Violence in Nicaragua Undermines Peace Talks 2 Months Into Uprising,"June 19, 2018 /  7:58 P",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nicaragua-protest/violence-flares-up-in-nicaragua-after-suspension-of-peace-talks-idUSKBN1JF2WG,"MASAYA, Nicaragua (Reuters) - Nicaraguan police and masked gunmen clashed with anti-government protesters on Tuesday, leaving at least six dead following the suspension of peace talks to quell two months of deadly demonstrations, a human rights group said.

Nicaragua has been convulsed by unrest since Ortega in April proposed cutting pension benefits to cover a social security shortfall. The plan, later dropped, triggered demonstrations that turned fatal and led to demands for his resignation. Slideshow (9 Images)Since then, at least 174 people have been killed in clashes between pro-Ortega forces and demonstrators, rights groups say. Representatives of civil society organizations have called for early elections to end the impasse, but they broke off talks with the government on Monday until Ortega sent an invitation for international observers to enter the Central American country. Juan Sebastian Chamorro, a leader of the main civic alliance seeking to broker agreement with the government, said there was no point in holding further talks about early elections “while people are being killed in the street.” The U.S. government on Monday urged Nicaragua to stage early elections to end the violence, and Carlos Trujillo, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States, (OAS) was due to arrive in Managua on Tuesday.  Trujillo is scheduled to hold meetings to take stock of the situation ahead of an OAS permanent council special session on Nicaragua on Friday.

People across Canada were grappling on Wednesday with the legalization of recreational marijuana, which represents one of the most sweeping changes in Canadian culture in decades.Many questions remain, including whether law enforcement will be able to tame a vibrant black market for cannabis that has been thriving in the shadows and whether consumers will reject smoking government-approved joints.The Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had argued that legalization was necessary to eliminate an illegal cannabis industry estimated to be worth as much as $7 billion a year and to protect young people from the risks of illegal drugs. The law will go into effect on Oct. 17, Mr. Trudeau said Wednesday, to give provinces time to get their retail systems running.But proponents of marijuana legalization may face an unlikely challenge: customers who worry that government-approved products will take some of the thrill out of pot smoking. Tristan Peloquin, a Montreal-based author of a soon-to-be-published book, ‚The Little Green Book of Cannabis: A Survival Guide,‚ predicted that veteran consumers would come around. ‚Smoking pot has long been a rebellious anti-government activity,‚‚ he said, ‚but some of the illegal stuff has pesticides and pot smokers will ultimately want better quality pot.‚The Quebec Cannabis Company, the new provincial marijuana monopoly, has been examining how to sell cannabis, given restrictions that, for example, forbid glamorizing it in marketing or selling it in glass display cases behind a counter.Mathieu Gaudreault, a spokesman for the company, said customers might be able to at least smell the marijuana, which will be sold in sealed sachets, ‚as if they were smelling perfume.‚ Customers will be asked for identification at the entrance to retail stores to prove that they are at least 18 years old, the legal age for buying alcohol and cannabis in Quebec.At the official stores, one gram will cost about $6; other products will be offered, both at stores and online, with different degrees of potency.While Canadians will soon be allowed to smoke and sell marijuana with impunity for the first time in 95 years, hundreds of illegal dispensaries have already popped up across the country, underlining the challenges the government and law enforcement will face.Trees Station, one of many illegal pot dispensaries in Toronto‚s bohemian Kensington Market, has been open for two years, selling more than 30 different kinds of marijuana, with names like Pink Cinderella and Organic Charlotte‚s Web. The drug is offered in capsules and extract form, too. Customers can buy THC lip balm and a canine calming cannabis powder called Calm and Quiet. Business is so good, the owners have no intention of shutting down when the new law goes into effect in October. Instead, they have plans to open two new sites.‚We‚re going to keep on doing what we‚re doing,‚ said Nathan Murdock, the store manager.The store presents itself as if it were a medical dispensary. There is a green cross on a signboard on the street outside and a note on the door that warns buyers that they need to show an ID, as they would at an authorized dispensary.But it is just a pretense. Inside, the staff serves a continual line of shoppers from behind a glass counter, sorting through their orders wearing latex gloves.Although Canada legalized medical marijuana in 2001, and today patients must order marijuana by mail from producers licensed by the government, hundreds of black market dispensaries have proliferated. On Wednesday afternoon, Eartha Masek-Kelly, a 21-year-old musician, bought a quarter of an ounce of Green House Ocean Grown Kush from the counter as she had done every other day for the past year to calm her anxiety and depression.‚Why put resources into shutting down independent retailers that are just helping people?‚ she asked. In effort to rein in illegal dispensaries, Ontario has passed tough laws allowing the police to shut them down. But as quickly as some illegal stores have been shut down, others have opened up.Staff Sgt. Lesley Hildred of the Toronto Police said officers took the door off one of the closed dispensaries to ensure that it could not reopen quickly. ‚It takes a lot of police hours,‚ the sergeant said. ‚We can‚t be there enforcing the law all the time. I have other things to do.‚Mr. Peloquin said that some legal medical marijuana growers had been selling their surplus crop to illegal sites that peddle marijuana online.‚There is a massive gray market already and the police know it exists,‚‚ he said. ‚But if they arrest someone and a person shows they are a designated producer, it is hard to prove criminal intent. So it is very hard to clamp down on this.‚G√©rard Deltell, an opposition Conservative member of the federal Parliament from Quebec City, argued that the government had rushed to legalize marijuana before law enforcement in some provinces were ready. He predicted that organized crime would continue to hold sway.‚It is shocking that the Canadian government wants to become the pot dealer for the nation,‚ he said.Mr. Letendre, the retired radio host, offered perhaps the most dire vision of what legalization might produce. ‚Young people from all over the world will come to smoke weed in Montreal, and we will soon become a country of potheads,‚ he said as he rode his electric scooter through downtown Montreal. But other people, especially young ones, view legalization as an enormous business prospect.Mr. Rossant, 21, the recent university graduate, is starting a marijuana lifestyle magazine called Maples. He also wants to produce a variety of maple-derived, marijuana-infused products, and he is hoping that the law will be liberalized as demand grows.‚For a young entrepreneur like me, the pot industry feels easier to get into than the tech sector,‚ he said. ‚Besides, we millennials have the know-how when it comes to the pot-market ‚ we have all smoked pot.‚",Canadians Brace for Cultural Changes as Marijuana Becomes Legal,"June 8, 2018 /  2:12 AM",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-marijuana/canada-clears-major-hurdle-in-legalizing-recreational-marijuana-idUSKCN1J4074,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s Senate on Thursday voted to legalize recreational marijuana, clearing a major hurdle that puts the country on track to become the first Group of Seven nation to permit national use of the drug. FILE PHOTO: A marijuana plant is seen at the The Global Marijuana March in Toronto, May 7, 2011.   REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo The upper chamber Senate voted 56-30 in favor of the legislation but included amendments that the House of Commons will need to decide on before the law can be passed. While there is not yet a definite date for when marijuana will be available for sale, the Senate was one of the last significant obstacles standing in the way of legalization as a number of Conservative senators oppose the bill. Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said earlier this year that marijuana would only go on sale a few months after it was legalized because the new retail system needs time to start working properly. The amendments proposed by the Senate include tighter advertising restrictions and giving the provinces say over whether Canadians can grow marijuana at home. The government’s legislation would allow Canadians to grow up to four plants at home for personal use. Although legalization has already been delayed from the government’s initially planned July launch, some provinces and police forces have argued they need more time. The provinces have been left in charge establishing how and where marijuana will be sold.  The Liberals, which made legalizing recreational use part of their successful 2015 election campaign, say the new law would keep marijuana out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime. Canadian marijuana companies like Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria Inc, Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF and Aurora Cannabis Inc have been at the center of investor frenzy surrounding attempts to legalize marijuana for recreational use nationwide.

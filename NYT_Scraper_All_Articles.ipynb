       "'SEOUL South Korea North Korea threw President Trump’s planned summit meeting with its leader Kim Jong un into doubt on Wednesday threatening to call off the landmark encounter if the United States insisted on “unilateral nuclear abandonment The warning made by the North’s disarmament negotiator caught Trump administration officials off guard and set off an internal debate over whether Mr Kim was merely posturing in advance of the meeting in Singapore next month or was erecting a serious new hurdle The abrupt change in tone began early Wednesday when North Korea indefinitely postponed high level talks with South Korea over the North’s sudden objection to joint military drills by the South and the United States that began last week The North also raised the possibility of scrapping the meeting with Mr Trump Then hours later the North broadened the source of its anger and sharpened the threat to the summit with Mr Trump Kim Kye kwan a vice foreign minister rejected the administration’s demand that it quickly dismantle its nuclear program as Libya had done 15 years ago singling out John R Bolton Mr Trump’s new national security adviser for condemnation “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the D P R K U S summit the statement said using the abbreviation for the North’s formal name the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Mr Kim said his country would never follow the path of Libya and Iraq which he said met a “miserable fate at the hands of “big powers He said North Korea had “shed light on the quality of Bolton in the past “and we do not hide our feelings of repugnance towards him North Korea had previously signaled flexibility about the military exercises appearing to remove a perennial obstacle to talks between North and South Korea But the North cited its objections to the joint American South Korean air force drill in postponing a separate high level meeting with South Korea that had been planned for Wednesday As the White House scrambled to assess the North Korean statements the State Department said planning for the June 12 summit meeting remained on track and pointed to Mr Kim’s earlier acceptance of the exercises which had been conveyed to the United States by South Korean officials The North Korean statements injected sudden tension and uncertainty into what had been months of warming relations on the Korean Peninsula most notably the summit meeting between Mr Kim and President Moon Jae in of South Korea on April 27 and their declaration to pursue peace The confusion created by the statements also underscored the risks for Mr Trump in meeting with the 34 year old North Korean leader And it served as a reminder that for all of Mr Kim’s camera ready smiles and diplomatic gestures of recent months North Korea remains an opaque unpredictable country “The South Korean authorities and the United States launched a large scale joint air force drill against our Republic even before the ink on the historic inter Korean declaration has dried the official Korean Central News Agency said earlier in the day “There is a limit to our good will “We will be closely watching the attitude of the United States and South Korean authorities the news agency added It declared that the drill known as Max Thunder was a “deliberate military provocation that had violated the inter Korean summit declaration The United States and South Korea the North’s statement said had mobilized 100 aircraft in the exercise to “make a pre emptive airstrike and “win the air Senior officials from the two Koreas had been scheduled to meet in the “truce village of Panmunjom on their border Wednesday to discuss putting in place an agreement to improve ties and ease military tensions building on the declaration signed by their leaders on April 27 The Pentagon said Max Thunder was an annual exercise to maintain military readiness to defend South Korea “The defensive nature of these combined exercises has been clear for many decades and has not changed said a Defense Department spokesman Col Rob Manning The State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said “Kim Jong un had said previously that he understands the need and the utility of the United States and the Republic of Korea continuing in its joint exercises They are exercises that are legal They’re planned well well in advance She also said the United States had received no notification of a change in plans for the summit meeting “We will continue to go ahead and plan the meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong un she said There was some ambiguity about whether Mr Kim had dropped his objection to all joint exercises or merely the ones that were underway at the time that he opened a dialogue with Mr Moon When Mr Kim met with South Korean envoys in March he agreed to meet with Mr Moon despite a round of joint military drills that were about to be conducted South Korean envoys quoted Mr Kim as saying he understood that those exercises must continue But those drills are over The new round of annual United States South Korean drills began last Friday In their March meeting Mr Kim told the South Korean emissaries that he hoped the United States and South Korea would “readjust their annual military drills “when the situation stabilizes according to the envoys Joel S Wit a senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who negotiated with North Korea during the Clinton administration said Mr Kim was pulling a page from Mr Trump’s playbook “It’s probably them acting like North Koreans after being pussy cats since January he said “Acting like tough guys Like Trump saying he would walk out of the summit if he didn’t like the deal Christopher R Hill who negotiated with North Korea during the George W Bush administration said it was possible that the threat was serious The North he noted has a history of insulting the South and normally the United States comes to the defense of its ally Mr Trump did not immediately react to Mr Kim’s warning and the White House issued only a bland statement “The United States will look at what North Korea has said independently and continue to coordinate closely with our allies said Sarah Huckabee Sanders the White House press secretary While Mr Trump has raised expectations for a breakthrough with Mr Kim other officials have tried to strike a more cautious note In an interview on the CBS program “Face the Nation last Sunday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who has met Mr Kim twice said “We have our eyes wide open with respect to the fact that the North Koreans have not proved worthy of their promises but we’re hopeful that this will be different Tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula have eased considerably since Mr Kim launched a fast paced string of diplomatic overtures in recent months starting with his decision to send North Korean athletes to the Winter Olympics held in the South in February Last month North Korea announced an end to all nuclear and long range missile tests Last week it freed three Americans held in North Korea sending them home with Mr Pompeo This week the North invited international journalists to watch its engineers shut down its only known nuclear test site later this month The two Koreas have also started dismantling loudspeakers they have used to blare propaganda broadcasts across the border It is not unusual for North Korea to abruptly cancel and postpone meetings with its neighbors The North’s decision to postpone the border talks was delivered only 15 hours after it proposed those talks on Tuesday and the South quickly accepted the offer In 2015 a North Korean band packed up and returned home only hours before it was scheduled to perform in Beijing in a gesture of friendship between the two countries’ Communist governments In January North Korea agreed to send an advance team of officials to the South to prepare for its participation in the Winter Olympics but abruptly delayed their trip “Seoul is a soft target said Lee Sung yoon a Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University referring to the North’s history of “periodically threatening to walk away from talks in order to raise its leverage during negotiations “The North will resume the canceled talks in time likely as early as later in the week'"

       "'SEOUL  South Korea   North Korea threw President Trump’s planned summit meeting with its leader  Kim Jong un  into doubt on Wednesday  threatening to call off the landmark encounter if the United States insisted on unilateral nuclear abandonment  The warning  made by the North’s disarmament negotiator  caught Trump administration officials off guard and set off an internal debate over whether Mr  Kim was merely posturing in advance of the meeting in Singapore next month or was erecting a serious new hurdle The abrupt change in tone began early Wednesday  when North Korea indefinitely postponed high level talks with South Korea over the North’s sudden objection to joint military drills by the South and the United States that began last week  The North also raised the possibility of scrapping the meeting with Mr  Trump  Then hours later  the North broadened the source of its anger and sharpened the threat to the summit with Mr  Trump  Kim Kye kwan  a vice foreign minister  rejected the administration’s demand that it quickly dismantle its nuclear program as Libya had done 15 years ago  singling out John R  Bolton  Mr  Trump’s new national security adviser  for condemnation If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment  we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the D P R K  U S  summit   the statement said  using the abbreviation for the North’s formal name  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Mr  Kim said his country would never follow the path of Libya and Iraq  which he said met a miserable fate  at the hands of big powers  He said North Korea had shed light on the quality of Bolton  in the past  and we do not hide our feelings of repugnance towards him   North Korea had previously signaled flexibility about the military exercises  appearing to remove a perennial obstacle to talks between North and South Korea  But the North cited its objections to the joint American South Korean air force drill in postponing a separate high level meeting with South Korea that had been planned for Wednesday As the White House scrambled to assess the North Korean statements  the State Department said planning for the June 12 summit meeting remained on track  and pointed to Mr  Kim’s earlier acceptance of the exercises  which had been conveyed to the United States by South Korean officials  The North Korean statements injected sudden tension and uncertainty into what had been months of warming relations on the Korean Peninsula  most notably the summit meeting between Mr  Kim and President Moon Jae in of South Korea on April 27 and their declaration to pursue peace The confusion created by the statements also underscored the risks for Mr  Trump in meeting with the 34 year old North Korean leader  And it served as a reminder that for all of Mr  Kim’s camera ready smiles and diplomatic gestures of recent months  North Korea remains an opaque  unpredictable country The South Korean authorities and the United States launched a large scale joint air force drill against our Republic even before the ink on the historic inter Korean declaration has dried   the official Korean Central News Agency said earlier in the day  There is a limit to our good will  We will be closely watching the attitude of the United States and South Korean authorities   the news agency added  It declared that the drill  known as Max Thunder  was a deliberate military provocation  that had violated the inter Korean summit declaration  The United States and South Korea  the North’s statement said  had mobilized 100 aircraft in the exercise to make a pre emptive airstrike  and win the air  Senior officials from the two Koreas had been scheduled to meet in the truce village  of Panmunjom on their border Wednesday to discuss putting in place an agreement to improve ties and ease military tensions  building on the declaration signed by their leaders on April 27 The Pentagon said Max Thunder was an annual exercise to maintain military readiness to defend South Korea  The defensive nature of these combined exercises has been clear for many decades and has not changed   said a Defense Department spokesman  Col  Rob Manning The State Department spokeswoman  Heather Nauert  said  Kim Jong un had said previously that he understands the need and the utility of the United States and the Republic of Korea continuing in its joint exercises  They are exercises that are legal  They’re planned well  well in advance  She also said the United States had received no notification of a change in plans for the summit meeting  We will continue to go ahead and plan the meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong un   she said There was some ambiguity about whether Mr  Kim had dropped his objection to all joint exercises  or merely the ones that were underway at the time that he opened a dialogue with Mr  Moon  When Mr  Kim met with South Korean envoys in March  he agreed to meet with Mr  Moon despite a round of joint military drills that were about to be conducted South Korean envoys quoted Mr  Kim as saying he understood that those exercises must continue  But those drills are over  The new round of annual United States South Korean drills began last Friday  In their March meeting  Mr  Kim told the South Korean emissaries that he hoped the United States and South Korea would readjust  their annual military drills when the situation stabilizes   according to the envoys Joel S  Wit  a senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who negotiated with North Korea during the Clinton administration  said Mr  Kim was pulling a page from Mr  Trump’s playbook It’s probably them acting like North Koreans after being pussy cats since January   he said  Acting like tough guys  Like Trump saying he would walk out of the summit if he didn’t like the deal  Christopher R  Hill  who negotiated with North Korea during the George W  Bush administration  said it was possible that the threat was serious  The North  he noted  has a history of insulting the South  and normally  the United States comes to the defense of its ally Mr  Trump did not immediately react to Mr  Kim’s warning  and the White House issued only a bland statement  The United States will look at what North Korea has said independently  and continue to coordinate closely with our allies   said Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary While Mr  Trump has raised expectations for a breakthrough with Mr  Kim  other officials have tried to strike a more cautious note  In an interview on the CBS program Face the Nation  last Sunday  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  who has met Mr  Kim twice  said  We have our eyes wide open with respect to the fact that the North Koreans have not proved worthy of their promises  but we’re hopeful that this will be different   Tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula have eased considerably since Mr  Kim launched a fast paced string of diplomatic overtures in recent months  starting with his decision to send North Korean athletes to the Winter Olympics held in the South in February Last month  North Korea announced an end to all nuclear and long range missile tests  Last week  it freed three Americans held in North Korea  sending them home with Mr  Pompeo This week  the North invited international journalists to watch its engineers shut down its only known nuclear test site later this month  The two Koreas have also started dismantling loudspeakers they have used to blare propaganda broadcasts across the border It is not unusual for North Korea to abruptly cancel and postpone meetings with its neighbors  The North’s decision to postpone the border talks was delivered only 15 hours after it proposed those talks on Tuesday and the South quickly accepted the offer In 2015  a North Korean band packed up and returned home only hours before it was scheduled to perform in Beijing in a gesture of friendship between the two countries’ Communist governments  In January  North Korea agreed to send an advance team of officials to the South to prepare for its participation in the Winter Olympics  but abruptly delayed their trip Seoul is a soft target   said Lee Sung yoon  a Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University  referring to the North’s history of periodically threatening to walk away from talks  in order to raise its leverage during negotiations  The North will resume the canceled talks in time   likely as early as later in the week  '"
